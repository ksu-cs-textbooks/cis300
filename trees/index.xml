      <description>Priority Queues Often we need a data structure that supports efficient storage of data items and their subsequent retrieval in order of some pre-determined priority. We have already seen two instances of such data structures: stacks and queues. With a stack, the later the item is stored, the higher its priority. With a queue, the earlier the item is stored, the higher its priority. More generally, we would like to be able to set priorities arbitrarily, in a way that may be unrelated to the order in which they were stored.</description>
