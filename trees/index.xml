      <description>Binary Search Trees We motivated our discussion of trees by expressing a need for a linked data structure that supports a binary search or something similar. We will present such a data structure - a binary search tree - in this section. While it will support efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions for many applications, we will see that there are cases in which it performs no better than a linked list.</description>
