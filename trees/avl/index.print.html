<h2 id="avl-trees">AVL Trees</h2>
<p>Up to this point, we haven&rsquo;t addressed the performance of binary search
trees. In considering this performance, let&rsquo;s assume that the time
needed to compare two keys is bounded by some fixed constant. The main
reason we do this is that this cost doesn&rsquo;t depend on the number of keys
in the tree; however, it may depend on the sizes of the keys, as, for
example, if keys are <strong>string</strong>s. However, we will ignore this
complication for the purpose of this discussion.</p>
<p>Each of the methods we have described for finding a key, adding a key
and a value, or removing a key and its associated value, follows a
single path in the given tree. As a result, the time needed for each of
these methods is at worst proportional to the <em>height</em> of the tree,
where the height is defined to be the length of the longest path from
the root to any node. (Thus, the height of a one-node tree is <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>,</span> because
no steps are needed to get from the root to the only node - the root
itself &mdash; and the height of a two-node tree is always <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span>.</span>) In other words,
we say that the worst-case running time of each of these methods is in
<span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ O(h) $</span>,</span> where 
<span class="math align-center">$ h $</span> is the height of the tree.</p>
<p>Depending on the shape of the tree, 
<span class="math align-center">$ O(h) $</span> running time might be very
good. For example, it is possible to show that if keys are randomly
taken from a uniform distribution and successively added to an initially
empty binary search tree, the expected height is in <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ O(\log n) $</span>,</span>
where 
<span class="math align-center">$ n $</span> is the number of nodes. In this case, we would expect
logarithmic performance for lookups, insertions, and deletions. In fact,
there are many applications in which the height of a binary search tree
remains fairly small in comparison to the number of nodes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, such a shape is by no means guaranteed. For example,
suppose a binary search tree were built by adding the <strong>int</strong> keys 1
through 
<span class="math align-center">$ n $</span> in increasing order. Then 1 would go at the root, and 2
would be its right child. Each successive key would then be larger than
any key currently in the tree, and hence would be added as the right
child of the last node on the path going to the right. As a result, the
tree would have the following shape:</p>
<p><img src="bst-chain.jpg" alt="A badly-shaped binary search tree"></p>
<p>The height of this tree is <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ n - 1 $</span>;</span> consequently, lookups will
take time linear in <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ n $</span>,</span> the number of elements, in the worst case. This
performance is comparable with that of a linked list. In order to
guaranteed good performance, we need a way to ensure that the height of
a binary search tree does not grow too quickly.</p>
<p>One way to accomplish this is to require that each node always has
children that differ in height by at most <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span>.</span> In order for this
restriction to make sense, we need to extend the definition of the
height of a tree to apply to an empty tree. Because the height of a
one-node tree is <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>,</span> we will define the height of an empty tree to be <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ -1 $</span>.</span>
We call this restricted form of a binary search tree an <em>AVL tree</em>
(&ldquo;AVL&rdquo; stands for the names of the inventors, Adelson-Velskii and
Landis).</p>
<p>

<a href="http://people.cis.ksu.edu/~rhowell/viewer/minAVL.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This page</a>
contains a Java applet/application that displays an AVL tree of a given
height using as few nodes as possible. For example, the following screen
capture shows an AVL tree of height 
<span class="math align-center">$ 7 $</span> having a minimum number of nodes:</p>
<p><img src="min-avl.jpg" alt="An AVL tree with height 7 and minimum number of nodes"></p>
<p>As the above picture illustrates, a minimum of 
<span class="math align-center">$ 54 $</span> nodes are required for
an AVL tree to reach a height of <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ 7 $</span>.</span> In general, it can be shown that the
height of an AVL tree is at worst proportional to <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ \log n $</span>,</span> where 
<span class="math align-center">$ n $</span>
is the number of nodes in the tree. Thus, if we can maintain the shape
of an AVL tree efficiently, we should have efficient lookups and
updates.</p>
<p>Regarding the AVL tree shown above, notice that the tree is not as
well-balanced as it could be. For example, 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span> is at depth <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ 7 $</span>,</span> whereas <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ 52 $</span>,</span>
which also has two empty children, is only at depth <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span>.</span> Furthermore, it
is possible to arrange 
<span class="math align-center">$ 54 $</span> nodes into a binary tree with height as small
as <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span>.</span> However, maintaining a more-balanced structure would likely
require more work, and as a result, the overall performance might not be
as good. As we will show in what follows, the balance criterion for an
AVL tree can be maintained without a great deal of overhead.</p>
<p>The first thing we should consider is how we can efficiently determine
the height of a binary tree. We don&rsquo;t want to have to explore the entire
tree to find the longest path from the root &mdash; this would be way too
expensive. Instead, we store the height of a tree as a <strong>private</strong> field
in its root. If our nodes are mutable, we would also need to provide a
<strong>public</strong> property to give read/write access to this field. However,
such a setup places the burden of maintaining the heights on the user of
the binary tree node class. Using immutable nodes allows a much cleaner
(albeit slightly less efficient) solution. In what follows, we will show
how to modify the definition of an immutable binary tree node so that
whenever a binary tree is created from such nodes, the resulting tree is
guaranteed to satisfy the AVL tree balance criterion. As a result, user
code will be able to form AVL trees as if they were ordinary binary
search trees.</p>
<p>In order to allow convenient and efficient access to the height, even
for empty trees, we can provide a <strong>static</strong> method to take a binary
tree node as its only parameter and return its height. Making this
method <strong>static</strong> will allow us to handle empty (i.e., <strong>null</strong>) trees.
If the tree is empty, this method will return <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ -1 $</span>;</span> otherwise, it will
return the height stored in the tree. This method can be <strong>public</strong>.</p>
<p>We then can modify the constructor so that it initializes the height
field. Using the above method, it can find the heights of each child,
and add 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span> to the maximum of these values. This is the height of the node
being constructed. It can initialize the height field to this value, and
because the nodes are immutable, this field will store the correct
height from that point on.</p>
<p>Now that we have a way to find the height of a tree efficiently, we can
focus on how we maintain the balance property. Whenever an insertion or
deletion would cause the balance property to be violated for a
particular node, we perform a <em>rotation</em> at that node. Suppose, for
example, that we have inserted an element into a node&rsquo;s left child, and
that this operation causes the height of the new left child to be two
greater than the height of the right child (note that this same scenario
could have occurred if we had removed an element from the right child).
We can then rotate the tree using a <em>single rotate right</em>:</p>
<p><img src="single-rotate.jpg" alt="A single rotate right"></p>
<p>The tree on the left above represents the tree whose left child has a
height 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2 $</span> greater than its right child. The root and the lines to its
children are drawn using dashes to indicate that the root node has not
yet been constructed &mdash; we have at this point simply built a new left
child, and the tree on the left shows the tree that would be formed if
we were building an ordinary binary search tree. The circles in the
picture indicate individual nodes, and the triangles indicate arbitrary
trees (which may be empty). Note that the because the left child has a
height 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2 $</span> greater than the right child, we know that the left child
cannot be empty; hence, we can safely depict it as a node with two
children. The labels are chosen to indicate the order of the elements &mdash;
e.g., as &ldquo;a&rdquo; 
<span class="math align-center">$ \lt $</span> &ldquo;b&rdquo;, every key in tree <em>a</em> is less than the key in
node <em>b</em>. The tree on the right shows that tree that would be built by
performing this rotation. Note that the rotation preserves the order of
the keys.</p>
<p>Suppose the name of our class implementing a binary tree node is
<strong>BinaryTreeNode&lt;T&gt;</strong>, and suppose it has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data:</strong> gets the data stored in the node.</li>
<li><strong>LeftChild:</strong> gets the left child of the node.</li>
<li><strong>RightChild:</strong> gets the right child of the node.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the following code can be used to perform a single rotate right:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-C#" data-lang="C#"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>

<p>Don&rsquo;t try to write the code for doing rotations without looking at pictures of the rotations.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Now that we have seen what a single rotate right does and how to code
it, we need to consider whether it fixes the problem. Recall that we
were assuming that the given left child (i.e., the tree rooted at <em>b</em> in
the tree on the left above) has a height 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2 $</span> greater than the given right
child (i.e., the tree <em>e</em> in the tree on the left above). Let&rsquo;s suppose
the tree <em>e</em> has height <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ h $</span>.</span> Then the tree rooted at <em>b</em> has height
<span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ h + 2 $</span>.</span> By the definition of the height of a tree, either <em>a</em>
or <em>c</em> (or both) must have height <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ h + 1 $</span>.</span> Assuming that every
tree we&rsquo;ve built so far is an AVL tree, the children of <em>b</em> must differ
in height by at most <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ 2 $</span>;</span> hence, <em>a</em> and <em>c</em> must both have a height of at
least 
<span class="math align-center">$ h $</span> and at most <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ h + 1 $</span>.</span></p>
<p>Given these heights, let&rsquo;s examine the tree on the right. We have
assumed that every tree we&rsquo;ve built up to this point is an AVL tree, so
we don&rsquo;t need to worry about any balances within <em>a</em>, <em>c</em>, or <em>e</em>.
Because <em>c</em> has either height 
<span class="math align-center">$ h $</span> or height 
<span class="math align-center">$ h + 1 $</span> and <em>e</em> has
height <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ h $</span>,</span> the tree rooted at <em>d</em> satisfies the balance criterion.
However, if <em>c</em> has height 
<span class="math align-center">$ h + 1 $</span> and <em>a</em> has height <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ h $</span>,</span> then
the tree rooted at <em>d</em> has height <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ h + 2 $</span>,</span> and the balance
criterion is <em>not</em> satisfied. On the other hand, if <em>a</em> has height
<span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ h + 1 $</span>,</span> the tree rooted at <em>d</em> will have a height of either

<span class="math align-center">$ h + 1 $</span> or <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ h + 2 $</span>,</span> depending on the height of <em>c</em>. In these
cases, the balance criterion is satisfied.</p>
<p>We therefore conclude that a single rotate right will restore the
balance if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The height of the original left child (i.e., the tree rooted at <em>b</em>
in the above figure) is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2 $</span> greater than the height of the original
right child (tree <em>e</em> in the above figure); and</li>
<li>The height of the left child of the original left child (tree <em>a</em> in
the above figure) is greater than the height of the original right
child (tree <em>e</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>For the case in which the height of the left child of the original left
child (tree <em>a</em>) is <em>not</em> greater than the height of the original right
child (tree <em>e</em>), we will need to use a different kind of rotation.</p>
<p>Before we consider the other kind of rotation, we can observe that if an
insertion or deletion leaves the right child with a height 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2 $</span> greater
than the left child and the right child of the right child with a height
greater than the left child, the mirror image of a single rotate right
will restore the balance. This rotation is called a <em>single rotate
left</em>:</p>
<p><img src="single-rotate-left.jpg" alt="A single rotate left"></p>
<p>Returning to the case in which the left child has a height 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2 $</span> greater
than the right child, but the left child of the left child has a height
no greater than the right child, we can in this case do a <em>double rotate
right</em>:</p>
<p><img src="double-rotate.jpg" alt="A double rotate right"></p>
<p>Note that we have drawn the trees a bit differently by showing more
detail. Let&rsquo;s now show that this rotation restores the balance in this
case. Suppose that in the tree on the left, <em>g</em> has height <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ h $</span>.</span> Then the
tree rooted at <em>b</em> has height <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ h + 2 $</span>.</span> Because the height of <em>a</em>
is no greater than the height of <em>g</em>, assuming all trees we have built
so far are AVL trees, <em>a</em> must have height <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ h $</span>,</span> and the tree rooted at
<em>d</em> must have height 
<span class="math align-center">$ h + 1 $</span> (thus, it makes sense to draw it as
having a root node). This means that <em>c</em> and <em>e</em> both must have heights
of either 
<span class="math align-center">$ h $</span> or <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ h - 1 $</span>.</span> It is now not hard to verify that the
balance criterion is satisfied at <em>b</em>, <em>f</em>, and <em>d</em> in the tree on the
right.</p>
<p>The only remaining case is the mirror image of the above &mdash; i.e., that
the right child has height 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2 $</span> greater than the left child, but the height
of the right child of the right child is no greater than the height of
the left child. In this case, a <em>double rotate left</em> can be applied:</p>
<p><img src="double-rotate-left.jpg" alt="A double rotate left"></p>
<p>We have shown how to restore the balance whenever the balance criterion
is violated. Now we just need to put it all together in a <strong>public
static</strong> method that will replace the constructor as far as user code is
concerned. In order to prevent the user from calling the constructor
directly, we also need to make the constructor <strong>private</strong>. We want this
<strong>static</strong> method to take the same parameters as the constructor:</p>
<ul>
<li>The data item that can be stored at the root, provided no rotation
is required.</li>
<li>The tree that can be used as the left child if no rotation is
required.</li>
<li>The tree that can be used as the right child if no rotation is
required.</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of this method is to build a tree including all the given
nodes, with the given data item following all nodes in the left child
and preceding all nodes in the right child, but satisfying the AVL tree
balance criterion. Because this method will be the only way for user
code to build a tree, we can assume that both of the given trees satisfy
the AVL balance criterion. Suppose that the name of the <strong>static</strong>
method to get the height of a tree is <strong>Height</strong>, and that the names of
the methods to do the remaining rotations are <strong>SingleRotateLeft</strong>,
<strong>DoubleRotateRight</strong>, and <strong>DoubleRotateLeft</strong>, respectively. Further
suppose that the parameter lists for each of these last three methods
are the same as for <strong>SingleRotateRight</strong> above. The following method
can then be used to build AVL trees:</p>

call the above wherever it would have invoked the
<strong>BinaryTreeNode&lt;T&gt;</strong> constructor in building and maintaining an
ordinary binary search tree. The extra overhead is fairly minimal &mdash; each
time a new node is constructed, we need to check a few heights (which
are stored in fields), and if a rotation is needed, construct one or two
extra nodes. As a result, because the height of an AVL tree is
guaranteed to be logarithmic in the number of nodes, the worst-case
running times of both lookups and updates are in <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ O(\log n) $</span>,</span> where

<span class="math align-center">$ n $</span> is the number of nodes in the tree.</p>
