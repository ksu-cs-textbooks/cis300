In considering this performance, let’s assume that the time needed to compare two keys is bounded by some fixed constant. The main reason we do this is that this cost doesn’t depend on the number of keys in the tree; however, it may depend on the sizes of the keys, as, for example, if keys are strings. However, we will ignore this complication for the purpose of this discussion.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/trees/avl/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
