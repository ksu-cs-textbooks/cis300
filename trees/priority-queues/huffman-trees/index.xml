Consider, for example, a plain text file like this copy of the U. S. Constitution. This file is encoded using UTF-8, the most common encoding for plain text files. The characters most commonly appearing in English-language text files are each encoded as one byte (i.e., eight bits) using this scheme. For example, in the text file referenced above, every character is encoded as a single byte (the first three bytes of the file are an optional code indicating that it is encoded in UTF-8 format).</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/trees/priority-queues/huffman-trees/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
