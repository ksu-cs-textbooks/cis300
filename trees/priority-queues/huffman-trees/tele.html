the general problem of compressing files. Consider, for example, a plain
text file like <a href=/cis300/trees/priority-queues/huffman-trees/pg5.txt>this copy of the U. S. Constitution</a>. This file
is encoded using UTF-8, the most common encoding for plain text files.
The characters most commonly appearing in English-language text files
are each encoded as one byte (i.e., eight bits) using this scheme. For
example, in the text file referenced above, every character is encoded
as a single byte (the first three bytes of the file are an optional code
indicating that it is encoded in UTF-8 format). Furthermore, some byte
values occur much more frequently than others. For example, the encoding
of the blank character occurs over 6000 times, whereas the encoding of
&lsquo;$&rsquo; occurs only once, and the encoding of &lsquo;=&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t occur at all.</p><p>One of the techniques used by most file compression schemes is to find a
variable-width encoding scheme for the file. Such a scheme uses fewer
bits to encode commonly-occurring byte values and more bits to encode
rarely-occurring byte values. Byte values that do not occur at all in
the file are not given an encoding.</p><p>Consider, for example, a file containing the single string,
&ldquo;Mississippi&rdquo;, with no control characters signaling the end of the line.
If we were to use one byte for each character, as UTF-8 would do, we
would need 11 bytes (or 88 bits). However, we could encode the
characters in binary as follows:</p><ul><li>M: 100</li><li>i: 0</li><li>p: 101</li><li>s: 11</li></ul><p>Obviously because each character is encoded with fewer than 8 bits, this
will give us a shorter encoding. However, because &lsquo;i&rsquo; and &rsquo;s&rsquo;, which
each occur four times in the string, are given shorter encodings than
&lsquo;M&rsquo; and &lsquo;p&rsquo;, which occur a total of three times combined, the number of
bits is further reduced. The encoded string is</p><pre><code>100011110111101011010
</code></pre><p>which is only 21 bits, or less than 3 bytes.</p><p>In constructing such an encoding scheme, it is important that the
encoded string can be decoded unambiguously. For example, it would
appear that the following scheme might be even better:</p><ul><li>M: 01</li><li>i: 0</li><li>p: 10</li><li>s: 1</li></ul><p>This scheme produces the following encoding:</p><pre><code>01011011010100
</code></pre><p>which is only 14 bits, or less than 2 bytes. However, when we try to
decode it, we immediately run into problems. Is the first 0 an &lsquo;i&rsquo; or
the first bit of an &lsquo;M&rsquo;? We could decode this string as &ldquo;isMsMsMisii&rdquo;,
or a number of other possible strings.</p><p>The first encoding above, however, has only one decoding, &ldquo;Mississippi&rdquo;.
The reason for this is that this encoding is based on the following
binary tree:</p><p><a href=#R-image-5303ad9fd294a882b03139d7d54ca747 class=lightbox-link><img alt="A Huffman tree" class="border lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis300/trees/priority-queues/huffman-trees/huffman.jpg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>
<a href=javascript:history.back(); class=lightbox-back id=R-image-5303ad9fd294a882b03139d7d54ca747><img alt="A Huffman tree" class="border lazy lightbox lightbox-image" loading=lazy src=/cis300/trees/priority-queues/huffman-trees/huffman.jpg></a></p><p>To get the encoding for a character, we trace the path to that character
from the root, and record a 0 each time we go left and a 1 each time we
go right. Thus, because the path to &lsquo;M&rsquo; is right, left, left, we have an
encoding of 100. To decode, we simply use the encoding to trace out a
path in the tree, and when we reach a character (or more generally, a
byte value), we record that value. If we form the tree such that each
node has either two empty children or two nonempty children, then when
tracing out a path, we will always either have a choice of two
alternatives or be at a leaf storing a byte value. The decoding will
therefore be unambiguous. Such a tree that gives an encoding whose
length is minimized over all such encodings is called a <em>Huffman tree</em>.</p><p>Before we can find a Huffman tree for a file, we need to determine how
many times each byte value occurs. There are 256 different byte values
possible; hence we will need an array of 256 elements to keep track of
the number of occurrences of each. Because files can be large, this
array should be a <strong>long[ ]</strong>. We can then use element <em>i</em> of this
array to keep track of the number of occurrences of byte value <em>i</em>.
Thus, after constructing this array, we can read the file one byte at a
time as described in <a href=/cis300/io/other-file-io/>&ldquo;Other File
I/O&rdquo;</a>, and for each
<strong>byte</strong> <code>b</code> that we read, we increment the value at location <code>b</code> of the
array.</p><p>Having built this frequency table, we can now use it to build a Huffman
tree. We will build this tree from the bottom up, storing subtrees in a
min-priority queue. The priority of each subtree will be the total
number of occurrences of all the byte values stored in its leaves. We
begin by building a 1-node tree from each nonzero value in the frequency
table. As we iterate through the frequency table, if we find that
location <em>i</em> is nonzero, we construct a node containing <em>i</em> and add that
node to the min-priority queue. The priority we use when adding the node
is the number of occurrences of <em>i</em>, which is simply the value at
location <em>i</em> of the frequency table.</p><p>Once the min-priority queue has been loaded with the leaves, can begin
combining subtrees into larger trees. We will need to handle as a
special case an empty min-priority queue, which can result only from an
empty input file. In this case, there is no Huffman tree, as there are
no byte values that need to be encoded. Otherwise, as long as the
min-priority queue has more than one element, we:</p><ul><li>Get and remove the two smallest priorities and their associated
trees.</li><li>Construct a new binary tree with these trees as its children and 0
as its data (which will be unused).</li><li>Add the resulting tree to the min-priority queue with a priority
equal to the sum of the priorities of its children.</li></ul><p>Because each iteration removes two elements from the min-priority queue
and adds one, eventually the min-priority queue will contain only one
element. It can be shown that this last remaining element is a Huffman
tree for the file.</p><p>Most file compression schemes involve more than just converting to a
Huffman-tree encoding. Furthermore, even if this is the only technique
used, simply writing the encoded data is insufficient to compress the
file, as the Huffman tree is needed to decompress it. Therefore, some
representation of the Huffman tree must also be written. In addition, a
few extra bits may be needed to reach a byte boundary. Because of this,
the length of the decompressed file is also needed for decompression so
that the extra bits are not interpreted as part of the encoded data. Due
to this additional output, compressing a short file will likely result
in a longer file than the original.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div><script>window.MathJax=Object.assign(window.MathJax||{},{tex:{inlineMath:[["\\(","\\)"],["$","$"]],displayMath:[["\\[","\\]"],["$$","$$"]]},options:{enableMenu:!1}},JSON.parse("{}"))</script><script id=MathJax-script async src=/cis300/js/mathjax/tex-mml-chtml.js?1769099586></script><script src=/cis300/js/clipboard/clipboard.min.js?1769099586 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/perfect-scrollbar/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1769099586 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/theme.min.js?1769099586 defer></script></div><script src=/cis300/js/tele-scroll.min.js?1769099586 defer></script></body></html>
