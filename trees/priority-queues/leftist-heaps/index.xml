For any tree t, null path length of t is defined to be $ 0 $ if t is empty, or one more than the minimum of the null path lengths of its children if t is nonempty. Another way to understand this concept is that it gives the minimum number of steps needed to get from the root to an empty subtree. For an empty tree, there is no root, so we somewhat arbitrarily define the null path length to be $ 0 $. For single-node trees or binary trees with at least one empty child, the null path length is $ 1 $ because only one step is needed to reach an empty subtree.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/trees/priority-queues/leftist-heaps/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
