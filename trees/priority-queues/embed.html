We have already seen two instances of such data structures: stacks and queues. With a stack, the later the item is stored, the higher its priority. With a queue, the earlier the item is stored, the higher its
priority. More generally, we would like to be able to set priorities arbitrarily, in a way that may be unrelated to the order in which they were stored.</p><p>The general name for such a data structure is a <em>priority queue</em>. Priority queues typically support the following operations:</p><ul><li>Adding a data element, together with a priority.</li><li>Obtaining the number of data elements currently in the structure.</li><li>Obtaining the maximum of all priorities of elements in the structure.</li><li>Removing a data element having maximum priority.</li></ul><p>Obviously, the last two operations above can only be done when the structure is nonempty. A variation on the above focuses on minimum priority rather than maximum priority. This variation is called a <em>min-priority queue</em>. Because we will later cover applications of min-priority queues, we will focus on this variation in this section. In the sub-sections that follow, we will first consider a general structure that can be used in various ways to give efficient priority queue implementations. We will then look at one specific implementation. We will conclude by giving an example of how min-priority queues are used in file compression algorithms.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div><script src=/cis300/js/clipboard.min.js?1737579063 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1737579063 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/theme.js?1737579063 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/embed-iframe.js?1737579063 defer></script></body></html>
