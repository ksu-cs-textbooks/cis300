<h2 id="heaps">Heaps</h2>
<p>A common structure for implementing a priority queue is known as a
<em>heap</em>. A heap is a tree whose nodes contain elements with priorities
that can be ordered. Furthermore, if the heap is nonempty, its root
contains the maximum priority of any node in the heap, and each of its
children is also a heap. Note that this implies that, in any subtree,
the maximum priority is at the root. We define a <em>min-heap</em> similarly,
except that the minimum priority is at the root. Below is an example of
a min-heap with integer priorities (the data elements are not shown &mdash;
only their priorities):</p>
<p><img src="heap.jpg" alt="A min-heap."></p>
<p>Note that this structure is different from a binary search tree, as
there are elements in the left child that have larger priorities than
the root. Although some ordering is imposed on the nodes (i.e.,
priorities do not decrease as we go down a path from the root), the
ordering is less rigid than for a binary search tree. As a result, there
is less overhead involved in maintaining this ordering; hence, a
min-heap tends to give better performance than an AVL tree, which could
also be used to implement a min-priority queue. Although the definition
of a heap does not require it, the implementations we will consider will
be binary trees, as opposed to trees with an arbitrary number of
children.</p>

<p>The heap data structure is
unrelated to the pool of memory from which instances of reference types
are constructed &mdash; this also, unfortunately, is called a heap.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>One advantage to using a min-heap to implement a min-priority queue is
fairly obvious &mdash; an element with minimum priority is always at the root
if the min-heap is nonempty. This makes it easy to find the minimum
priority and an element with this priority. Let&rsquo;s consider how we might
remove an element with minimum priority. Assuming the min-heap is
nonempty, we need to remove the element at the root. Doing so leaves us
with two min-heaps (either of which might be empty). To complete the
removal, we need a way to merge two min-heaps into one. Note that if we
can do this, we also have a way of adding a new element: we form a
1-node min-heap from the new element and its priority, then merge this
min-heap with the original one.</p>
<p>Let us therefore consider the problem of merging two min-heaps into one.
If either min-heap is empty, we can simply use the other one. Suppose
that both are nonempty. Then the minimum priority of each is located at
its root. The minimum priority overall must therefore be the smaller of
these two priorities. Let <em>s</em> denote the heap whose root has the smaller
priority and <em>b</em> denote the heap whose root has the larger priority.
Then the root of <em>s</em> should be the root of the resulting min-heap.</p>
<p>Now that we have determined the root of the result, let&rsquo;s consider what
we have left. <em>s</em> has two children, both of which are min-heaps, and <em>b</em>
is also a min-heap. We therefore have three min-heaps, but only two
places to put them - the new left and right children of <em>s</em>. To reduce
the number of min-heaps to two, we can merge two of them into one. This
is simply a recursive call.</p>
<p>We have therefore outlined a general strategy for merging two min-heaps.
There two important details that we have omitted, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which two min-heaps do we merge in the recursive call?</li>
<li>Which of the two resulting min-heaps do we make the new left child
of the new root?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are various ways these questions can be answered. Some ways lead
to efficient implementations, whereas others do not. For example, if we
always merge the right child of <em>s</em> with <em>b</em> and make the result the new
right child of the new root, it turns out that all of our min-heaps will have
empty left children. As a result, in the worst case, the time needed to
merge two min-heaps is proportional to the total number of elements in
the two min-heaps. This is poor performance. In 

<a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis300/trees/priority-queues/leftist-heaps">the next
section</a> we will
consider a specific implementation that results in a worst-case running
time proportional to the logarithm of the total number of nodes.</p>
