A heap is a tree whose nodes contain elements with priorities that can be ordered.

Note that this implies that, in any subtree, the maximum priority is at the root.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/trees/priority-queues/heaps/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
