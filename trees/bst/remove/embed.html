tree, we must first define exactly how we want the method to behave.
Consider first the case in which the tree is built from immutable nodes.
We are given a key and a binary search tree, and we want to return the
result of removing the element having the given key. However, we need to
decide what we will do if there is no element having the given key. This
does not seem to be exceptional behavior, as we may have no way of
knowing in advance whether the key is in the tree (unless we waste time
looking for it). Still, we might want to know whether the key was found.
We therefore need two pieces of information from this method - the
resulting tree and a <strong>bool</strong> indicating whether the key was found. In
order to accommodate this second piece of information, we make the
<strong>bool</strong> an <a href=/cis300/appendix/syntax/out-ref/><strong>out</strong> parameter</a>.</p><p>We can again break the problem into cases and use recursion, as we did
for <a href=/cis300/trees/bst/intro/>adding an element</a>. However, removing an element is complicated by the fact that its node
might have two nonempty children. For example, suppose we want to remove
the element whose key is 54 in the following binary search tree:</p><p><a href=#R-image-f92f497f4510ff9e827b08971ef88197 class=lightbox-link><img alt="A binary search tree" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis300/trees/bst/remove/binary-search-tree-ex.jpg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>
<a href=javascript:history.back(); class=lightbox-back id=R-image-f92f497f4510ff9e827b08971ef88197><img alt="A binary search tree" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading=lazy src=/cis300/trees/bst/remove/binary-search-tree-ex.jpg></a></p><p>In order to preserve the correct ordering of the keys, we should replace
54 with either the next-smaller key (i.e., 41) or the next-larger key
(i.e., 64). By convention, we will replace it with the next-larger key,
which is the smallest key in its right child. We therefore have a
sub-problem to solve - removing the element with the smallest key from a
nonempty binary search tree. We will tackle this problem first.</p><p>Because we will not need to remove the smallest key from an empty tree,
we don&rsquo;t need to worry about whether the removal was successful - a
nonempty binary search tree always has a smallest key. However, we still
need two pieces of information from this method:</p><ul><li>the element removed (so that we can use it to replace the element to
be removed in the original problem); and</li><li>the resulting tree (so that we can use it as the new right child in
solving the original problem).</li></ul><p>We will therefore use an <strong>out</strong> parameter for the element removed, and
return the resulting tree.</p><p>Because we don&rsquo;t need to worry about empty trees, and because the
smallest key in a binary search tree is never larger than the key at the
root, we only have two cases:</p><ul><li>The left child is empty. In this case, there are no keys smaller
than the key at the root; i.e., the key at the root is the smallest.
We therefore assign the data at the root to the <strong>out</strong> parameter,
and return the right child, which is the result of removing the
root.</li><li>The left child is nonempty. In this case, there is a key smaller
than the key at the root; furthermore, it must be in the left child.
We therefore use a recursive call on the left child to obtain the
result of removing the element with the smallest key from that child. We
can pass as the <strong>out</strong> parameter to this recursive call the <strong>out</strong>
parameter that we were given - the recursive call will assign to it
the element removed. Because our nodes are immutable, we then need to construct a new node whose data
and right child are the same as in the given tree, but whose left
child is the tree returned by the recursive call. We return this
node.</li></ul><p>Having this sub-problem solved, we can now return to the original
problem. We again have four cases, but one of these cases breaks into
three sub-cases:</p><ul><li>The tree is empty. In this case the key we are looking for is not
present, so we set the <strong>out</strong> parameter to <strong>false</strong> and return an
empty tree.</li><li>The key we are looking for is at the root. In this case, we can set
the <strong>out</strong> parameter to <strong>true</strong>, but in order to remove the
element, we have three sub-cases:<ul><li>The left child is empty. We can then return the right child (the
result of removing the root).</li><li>The right child is empty. We can then return the left child.</li><li>Both children are nonempty. We must then obtain the result of
removing the smallest key from the right child. We then
construct a new node whose data is the element removed from the
right child, the left child is the left child of the given tree,
and the right child is the result of removing the smallest key
from that child. We return this node.</li></ul></li><li>The key we are looking for is less than the key at the root. We then
obtain the result of removing this key from the left child using a
recursive call. We can pass as the <strong>out</strong> parameter to this
recursive call the <strong>out</strong> parameter we were given and let the
recursive call set its value. We then construct a new node whose
data and right child are the same as in the given tree, but whose
left child is the tree returned by the recursive call. We return
this node.</li><li>The key we are looking for is greater than the key at the root. This
case is symmetric to the above case.</li></ul><p>As we did with adding elements, we can optimize the methods described
above for mutable nodes by modifying the contents of a node rather than
constructing new nodes.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div><script src=/cis300/js/clipboard.min.js?1737579063 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1737579063 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/theme.js?1737579063 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/embed-iframe.js?1737579063 defer></script></body></html>
