Consider first the case in which the tree is built from immutable nodes. We are given a key and a binary search tree, and we want to return the result of removing the element having the given key. However, we need to decide what we will do if there is no element having the given key. This does not seem to be exceptional behavior, as we may have no way of knowing in advance whether the key is in the tree (unless we waste time looking for it). Still, we might want to know whether the key was found. We therefore need two pieces of information from this method - the resulting tree and a bool indicating whether the key was found. In order to accommodate this second piece of information, we make the bool an out parameter.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/trees/bst/remove/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
