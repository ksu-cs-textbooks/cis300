Here, the elements are strings, which are not stored explicitly in the trie, but implicitly based on the labels of various nodes. Thus, an individual node does not contain a string; however, if its bool has a value of true, then the path to that node describes a string stored in the trie. We can therefore associate this string with this node. Note that this string is a prefix of any string associated with any node in any of this node’s children; hence, it is alphabetically less than any string found in any of the children. Thus, in order to process each of the strings in alphabetic order, we need to do a preorder traversal, which processes the root before recursively processing the children.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/trees/tries/traversing/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
