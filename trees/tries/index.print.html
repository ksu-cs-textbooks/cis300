However, there are special cases where we can achieve better performance. One of these special cases occurs when we need to store a list of words, as we might need in a word game, for example. For such applications, a <em>trie</em> provides for even more efficient storage and retrieval.</p><p>In this section, we first define a trie and give a rather straightforward implementation. We then show how to improve performance by implementing different nodes in different ways. We then examine the use of a preorder traversal to traverse a trie. We conclude by discussing an example of using a trie in a word game.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><section><h1 class=a11y-only>Subsections of Tries</h1><article class=default><header class=headline></header><div hidden><h1 id=introduction-to-tries>Introduction to Tries</h1></div><h2 id=introduction-to-tries>Introduction to Tries</h2><p>A <em>trie</em> is a nonempty tree storing a set of words in the following way:</p><ul><li>Each child of a node is labeled with a character.</li><li>Each node contains a boolean indicating whether the labels in the
path from the root to that node form a word in the set.</li></ul><p>The word, &ldquo;trie&rdquo;, is taken from the middle of the word, &ldquo;retrieval&rdquo;, but
to avoid confusion, it is pronounced like &ldquo;try&rdquo; instead of like &ldquo;tree&rdquo;.</p><p>Suppose, for example, that we want to store the following words:</p><ul><li>ape</li><li>apple</li><li>cable</li><li>car</li><li>cart</li><li>cat</li><li>cattle</li><li>curl</li><li>far</li><li>farm</li></ul><p>A trie storing these words (where we denote a value of <strong>true</strong> for the
boolean with a <code>*</code>) is as follows:</p><p><a href=#R-image-a15433a7aaea9ed91051b4ec1f1bbf73 class=lightbox-link><img alt="A trie" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis300/trees/tries/intro/trie-example.jpg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>
<a href=javascript:history.back(); class=lightbox-back id=R-image-a15433a7aaea9ed91051b4ec1f1bbf73><img alt="A trie" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading=lazy src=/cis300/trees/tries/intro/trie-example.jpg></a></p><p>Thus, for example, if we follow the path from the root through the
labels &lsquo;c&rsquo;, &lsquo;a&rsquo;, and &lsquo;r&rsquo;, we reach a node with a <strong>true</strong> boolean value
(shown by the <code>*</code> in the above picture); hence, &ldquo;car&rdquo; is in this set of
words. However, if we follow the path through the labels &lsquo;c&rsquo;, &lsquo;u&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;r&rsquo;, the node we reach has a <strong>false</strong> boolean; hence, &ldquo;cur&rdquo; is not in
this set. Likewise, if we follow the path through &lsquo;a&rsquo;, we reach a node
from which there is no child labeled &lsquo;c&rsquo;; hence, &ldquo;ace&rdquo; is not in this
set.</p><p>Note that each subtree of a trie is also a trie, although the &ldquo;words&rdquo; it
stores may begin to look a little strange. For example if we follow the
path through &lsquo;c&rsquo; and &lsquo;a&rsquo; in the above figure, we reach a trie that
contains the following &ldquo;words&rdquo;:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;ble&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;r&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;rt&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;t&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;ttle&rdquo;</li></ul><p>These are actually the <em>completions</em> of the original words that begin
with the prefix &ldquo;ca&rdquo;. Note that if, in this subtree, we take the path
through &rsquo;t&rsquo;, we reach a trie containing the following completions:</p><ul><li>"" [i.e., the empty string]</li><li>&ldquo;tle&rdquo;</li></ul><p>In particular, the empty string is a word in this trie. This motivates
an alternative definition of the boolean stored in each node: it
indicates whether the empty string is stored in the trie rooted at this
node. This definition may be somewhat preferable to the one given above,
as it does not depend on any context, but instead focuses entirely on
the trie rooted at that particular node.</p><p>One of the main advantages of a trie over an <a href=/cis300/trees/avl/>AVL
tree</a> is the speed with
which we can look up words. Assuming we can quickly find the child with
a given label, the time we need to look up a word is proportional to the
length of the word, no matter how many words are in the trie. Note that
in looking up a word that is present in an AVL tree, we will at least
need to compare the given word with its occurrence in the tree, in
addition to any other comparisons done during the search. The time it
takes to do this one comparison is proportional to the length of the
word, as we need to verify each character (we actually ignored the cost
of such comparisons when we analyzed the performance of AVL trees).
Consequently, we can expect a significant performance improvement by
using a trie if our set of words is large.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s now consider how we can implement a trie. There are various ways
that this can be done, but we&rsquo;ll consider a fairly straightforward
approach in this section (we&rsquo;ll improve the implementation in <a href=/cis300/trees/tries/multiple-impl/>the next
section</a>). We
will assume that the words we are storing are comprised of only the 26
lower-case English letters. In this implementation, a single node will
contain the following <strong>private</strong> fields:</p><ul><li>A <strong>bool</strong> storing whether the empty string is contained in the trie
rooted at this node (or equivalently, whether this node ends a word
in the entire trie).</li><li>A 26-element array of nullable tries storing the children, where element 0
stores the child labeled &lsquo;a&rsquo;, element 1 stores the child labeled
&lsquo;b&rsquo;, etc. If there is no child with some label, the corresponding
array element is <strong>null</strong>.</li></ul><p>For maintainability, we should use <strong>private</strong> constants to store the above array&rsquo;s size (i.e., 26) and the first letter of the alphabet (i.e., &lsquo;a&rsquo;). Note that in this implementation, other than this last constant, no <strong>char</strong>s or <strong>string</strong>s are
actually stored. We can see if a node has a child labeled by a given
<strong>char</strong> by finding the difference between that <strong>char</strong> and and the first letter of the alphabet, and
using that difference as the array index. For example, suppose the array
field is named <code>_children</code>, the constant giving the first letter of the alphabet is <code>_alphabetStart</code>, and <code>label</code> is a <strong>char</strong> variable
containing a lower-case letter. Because <strong>char</strong> is technically a
numeric type, we can perform arithmetic with <strong>char</strong>s; thus, we can
obtain the child labeled by <code>label</code> by retrieving
<code>_children[label - _alphabetStart]</code>. More specifically, if <code>_alphabetStart</code> is &lsquo;a&rsquo; and <code>label</code>
contains &rsquo;d&rsquo;, then the difference, <code>label - _alphabetStart</code>, will be 3; hence,
the child with label &rsquo;d&rsquo; will be stored at index 3. We have therefore
achieved our goal of providing quick access to a child with a given
label.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s now consider how to implement a lookup. We can define a <strong>public</strong>
method for this purpose within the class implementing a trie node:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-C# data-lang=C#><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=kd>public</span> <span class=kt>bool</span> <span class=n>Contains</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=kt>string</span> <span class=n>s</span><span class=p>)</span>

</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>    <span class=p>.</span> <span class=p>.</span> <span class=p>.</span>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>    
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=p>}</span></span></span></code></pre></div><div class="box notices cstyle note"><div class=box-label><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Note</div><div class=box-content><p>This method does not need a trie node as a parameter because
the method will belong to a trie node. Thus, the method will be able to
access the node as
<a href=/cis300/appendix/syntax/static-this/><strong>this</strong></a>, and may
access its <strong>private</strong> fields directly by their names.</p></div></div><p>The method
consists of five cases:</p><ul><li><code>s</code> is <strong>null</strong>. Note that even though <code>s</code> is not defined to be nullable, because the method is <strong>public</strong>, user code could still pass a <strong>null</strong> value. In this case, we should throw an <strong>ArgumentNullException</strong>, provides more information than does a <strong>NullReferenceException</strong>.</li><li><code>s</code> is the empty <strong>string</strong>. In this case the <strong>bool</strong> stored in
this node indicates whether it is a word in this trie; hence, we can
simply return this <strong>bool</strong>.</li><li>The first character of <code>s</code> is not a lower-case English letter (i.e.,
it is less than &lsquo;a&rsquo; or greater than &lsquo;z&rsquo;). The constants defined for this class should be used in making this determination. In this case, <code>s</code> can&rsquo;t be stored
in this trie; hence, we can return <strong>false</strong>.</li><li>The child labeled with the first character of <code>s</code> (obtained as
described above) is missing (i.e., is <strong>null</strong>). Then <code>s</code> isn&rsquo;t
stored in this trie. Again, we return <strong>false</strong>.</li><li>The child labeled with the first character of <code>s</code> is present (i.e.,
non-<strong>null</strong>). In this case, we need to determine whether the
substring following the first character of <code>s</code> is in the trie rooted
at the child we retrieved. This can be found using a recursive call
to this method within the child trie node. We return the result of
this recursive call.</li></ul><p>In order to be able to look up words, we need to be able to build a trie
to look in. We therefore need to be able to add words to a trie. It&rsquo;s
not practical to make a trie node immutable, as there is too much
information that would need to be copied if we need to replace a node
with a new one (we would need to construct a new node for each letter of
each word we added). We therefore should provide a <strong>public</strong> method
within the trie node class for the purpose of adding a word to the trie
rooted at this node:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-C# data-lang=C#><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=kd>public</span> <span class=k>void</span> <span class=n>Add</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=kt>string</span> <span class=n>s</span><span class=p>)</span>

</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=p>}</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This time there are four cases:</p><ul><li><code>s</code> is <strong>null</strong>. This case should be handled as in the <strong>Contains</strong> method above.</li><li><code>s</code> is the empty <strong>string</strong>. Then we can record this word by setting
the <strong>bool</strong> in this node to <strong>true</strong>.</li><li>The first character of <code>s</code> is not a lower-case English letter. Then
we can&rsquo;t add the word. In this case, we&rsquo;ll need to throw an
exception.</li><li>The first character is a lower-case English letter. In this case, we
need to add the substring following the first character of <code>s</code> to
the child labeled with the first letter. We do this as follows:<ul><li>We first need to make sure that the child labeled with the first letter of <code>s</code> is non-<strong>null</strong>. Thus, if this child is <strong>null</strong>, we construct a new trie node and place
it in the array location for this child.</li><li>We can now
add the substring following the first letter of <code>s</code> to this child by
making a recursive call.</li></ul></li></ul><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><div hidden><h1 id=multiple-implementations-of-children>Multiple Implementations of Children</h1></div><h2 id=multiple-implementations-of-children>Multiple Implementations of Children</h2><p>The trie implementation given in <a href=/cis300/trees/tries/intro/>the previous
section</a> offers very
efficient lookups - a word of length
<span class="math align-center">$ m $</span> can be looked up in
<span class="math align-center">$ O(m) $</span>
time, no matter how many words are in the trie. However, it wastes a
large amount of space. In a typical trie, a majority of the nodes will
have no more than one child; however, each node contains a 26-element
array to store its children. Furthermore, each of these arrays is
automatically initialized so that all its elements are <strong>null</strong>. This
initialization takes time. Hence, building a trie may be rather
inefficient as well.</p><p>We can implement a trie more efficiently if we can customize the
implementation of a node based on the number of children it has. Because
most of the nodes in a trie can be expected to have either no children
or only one child, we can define alternate implementations for these
special cases:</p><ul><li>For a node with no children, there is no need to represent any
children - we only need the <strong>bool</strong> indicating whether the trie
rooted at this node contains the empty <strong>string</strong>.</li><li>For a node with exactly one child, we maintain a single reference to
that one child. If we do this, however, we won&rsquo;t be able to infer
the child&rsquo;s label from where we store the child; hence, we also need
to have a <strong>char</strong> giving the child&rsquo;s label. We also need the
<strong>bool</strong> indicating whether the trie rooted at this node contains
the empty <strong>string</strong>.</li></ul><p>For all other nodes, we can use an implementation similar to the one
outlined in <a href=/cis300/trees/tries/intro/>the previous
section</a>. We will still
waste some space with the nodes having more than one child but fewer
than 26; however, the amount of space wasted will now be much less.
Furthermore, in each of these three implementations, we can quickly
access the child with a given label (or determine that there is no such
child).</p><p>Conceptually, this sounds great, but we run into some obstacles as soon
as we try to implement this approach. Because we are implementing nodes
in three different ways, we need to define three different classes. Each
of these classes defines a different type. So how do we build a trie
from three different types of nodes? In particular, how do we define the
type of a child when that child may be any of three different types?</p><p>The answer is to use a C# construct called an <em>interface</em>. An interface
facilitates <em>abstraction</em> - hiding lower-level details in order to focus
on higher-level details. At a high level (i.e., ignoring the specific
implementations), these three different classes appear to be the same:
they are all used to implement tries of words made up of lower-case
English letters. More specifically, we want to be able to add a
<strong>string</strong> to any of these classes, as well as to determine whether they
contain a given <strong>string</strong>. An interface allows us to define a type that
has this functionality, and to define various sub-types that have
different implementations, but still have this functionality.</p><p>A simple example of an interface is
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.icomparable-1?view=net-6.0" rel=external target=_blank><strong>IComparable&lt;T></strong></a>.
Recall from the section, <a href=/cis300/dictionaries/linked-list-impl/>&ldquo;Implementing a Dictionary with a Linked

that we can constrain the keys in a dictionary implementation to be of a
type that can be ordered by using a <strong>where</strong> clause on the <strong>class</strong>

interface</a>
has been posted by Microsoft®. The essential part of this definition
is:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-C# data-lang=C#><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=kd>public</span> <span class=k>interface</span> <span class=nc>IComparable</span><span class=p>&lt;</span><span class=k>in</span> <span class=n>T</span><span class=p>&gt;</span>

</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=p>}</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>(Don&rsquo;t worry about the <strong>in</strong> keyword with the type parameter in the
first line.) This definition defines the type <strong>IComparable&lt;T></strong> as
having a method <strong>CompareTo</strong> that takes a parameter of the generic type
<strong>T?</strong> and returns an <strong>int</strong>. Note that there is no <strong>public</strong> or
<strong>private</strong> access modifier on the method definition. This is because
access modifiers are disallowed within interfaces &mdash; all definitions are
implicitly <strong>public</strong>. Note also that there is no actual definition of
the <strong>CompareTo</strong> method, but only a header followed by a semicolon.
Definitions of method bodies are also disallowed within interfaces &mdash; an
interface doesn&rsquo;t define the behavior of a method, but only how it
should be used (i.e., its parameter list and return type). For this
reason, it is impossible to construct an instance of an interface
directly. Instead, one or more sub-types of the interface must be
defined, and these sub-types must provide definitions for the behavior
of <strong>CompareTo</strong>. As a result, because the <strong>Dictionary&lt;TKey,
TValue></strong> class restricts type <strong>TKey</strong> to be a sub-type of
<strong>IComparable&lt;T></strong>, its can use the <strong>CompareTo</strong> method of any
instance of type <strong>TKey</strong>.</p><p>Now suppose that we want to define a class <strong>Fraction</strong> and use it as a
key in our dictionary implementation. We would begin the class
definition within Visual Studio® as follows:</p><img src=/cis300/trees/tries/multiple-impl/interface-example1.jpg alt="Beginning an implementation of an interface." style=zoom:67%><p>At the end of the first line of the <strong>class</strong> definition, <code>: IComparable&lt;Fraction></code> indicates that the class being defined is a
subtype of <strong>IComparable&lt;Fraction></strong>. In general, we can list one or
more interface names after the colon, separating these names with
commas. Each name that we list requires that all of the methods,
properties, and <a href=/cis300/appendix/syntax/indexers/>indexers</a>
from that interface must be fully defined within this class. If we hover
the mouse over the word, <code>IComparable&lt;Fraction></code>, a drop-down menu
appears. By selecting &ldquo;Implement interface&rdquo; from this menu, all of the
required members of the interface are provided for us:</p><img src=/cis300/trees/tries/multiple-impl/interface-example2.jpg alt="Interface members are auto-filled." style=zoom:67%><div class="box notices cstyle note"><div class=box-label><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Note</div><div class=box-content><p>In order to implement a method specified in an interface, we

includes all members of <strong>ICollection&lt;T></strong>, plus the ones listed. The
first member listed above specifies an indexer with a get accessor and a
set accessor.</p><p>Now that we have seen a little of what interfaces are all about, let&rsquo;s
see how we can use them to provide three different implementations of
trie nodes. We first need to define an interface, which we will call
<strong>ITrie</strong>, specifying the two <strong>public</strong> members of <a href=/cis300/trees/tries/intro/>our previous
implementation of a trie
node</a>. We do, however,
need to make one change to the way the <strong>Add</strong> method is called. This
change is needed because when we add a <strong>string</strong> to a trie, we may need
to change the implementation of the root node. We can&rsquo;t simply change
the type of an object - instead, we&rsquo;ll need to construct a new instance
of the appropriate implementation. Hence, the <strong>Add</strong> method will need
to return the root of the resulting trie. Because this node may have any
of the three implementations, the return type of this method should be
<strong>ITrie</strong>. Also, because we will need the constants from our previous implementation in each of the implementations of <strong>ITrie</strong>, the code will be more maintainable if we include them once within this interface definition. Note that this will have the effect of making them <strong>public</strong>. The <strong>ITrie</strong> interface is therefore as follows:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-c# data-lang=c#><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=cs>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>

</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=p>}</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>We will then need to define three classes, each of which implements the
above interface. We will use the following names for these classes:</p><ul><li><strong>TrieWithNoChildren</strong> will be used for nodes with no children.</li><li><strong>TrieWithOneChild</strong> will be used for nodes with exactly one child.</li><li><strong>TrieWithManyChildren</strong> will be used for all other nodes; this will
be the class described in <a href=/cis300/trees/tries/intro/>the previous
section</a> with a few
modifications.</li></ul><p>These three classes will be similar because they each will implement the
<strong>ITrie</strong> interface. This implies that they will each need a
<strong>Contains</strong> method and an <strong>Add</strong> method as specified by the interface
definition. However, the code for each of these methods will be
different, as will other aspects of the implementations.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s first discuss how the <strong>TrieWithManyChildren</strong> class will differ from the class described in <a href=/cis300/trees/tries/intro/>the previous
section</a>. First, its class statement will need to be modified to make the class implement the <strong>ITrie</strong> interface. This change will introduce a syntax error because the <strong>Add</strong> method in the <strong>ITrie</strong> interface has a return type of <strong>ITrie</strong>, rather than <strong>void</strong>. The return type of this method in the <strong>TrieWithManyChildren</strong> class will therefore need to be changed, and at the end <strong>this</strong> will need to be returned. Because the constants have been moved to the <strong>ITrie</strong> interface, their definitions will need to be removed from this class definition, and each occurrence will need to be prefixed by &ldquo;<strong>ITrie.</strong>&rdquo;. Throughout the class definition, the type of any trie should be made <strong>ITrie</strong>, except where a new trie is constructed in the <strong>Add</strong> method. Here, a new <strong>TrieWithNoChildren</strong> should be constructed.</p><p>Finally, a constructor needs to be defined for the <strong>TrieWithManyChildren</strong> class. This constructor will be used by the <strong>TrieWithOneChild</strong> class when it needs to add a new child. Because a <strong>TrieWithOneChild</strong> cannot have two children, a <strong>TrieWithManyChildren</strong> will need to be constructed instead. This constructor will need the following parameters:</p><ul><li>A <strong>string</strong> giving the string that the <strong>TrieWithOneChild</strong> class needs to add.</li><li>A <strong>bool</strong> indicating whether the constructed node should contain the empty string.</li><li>A <strong>char</strong> giving the label of the child stored by the <strong>TrieWithOneChild</strong>.</li><li>An <strong>ITrie</strong> giving the one child of the <strong>TrieWithOneChild</strong>.</li></ul><p>After doing some error checking to make sure the given <strong>string</strong> and <strong>ITrie</strong> are not <strong>null</strong> and that the given <strong>char</strong> is in the proper range, it will need to store the given <strong>bool</strong> in its <strong>bool</strong> field and store the given <strong>ITrie</strong> at the proper location of its array of children. Then, using its own <strong>Add</strong> method, it can add the given <strong>string</strong>.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s now consider the <strong>TrieWithOneChild</strong> class. It will need three <strong>private</strong> fields:</p><ul><li>A <strong>bool</strong> indicating whether this node contains the empty string.</li><li>A <strong>char</strong> giving the label of the only child.</li><li>An <strong>ITrie</strong> giving the only child.</li></ul><p>As with the <strong>TrieWithManyChildren</strong> class the <strong>TrieWithOneChild</strong> class needs a constructor to allow the <strong>TrieWithNoChildren</strong> class to be able to add a nonempty string. This constructor&rsquo;s parameters will be a
<strong>string</strong> to be stored (i.e., the one being added) and a <strong>bool</strong>
indicating whether the empty <strong>string</strong> is also to be stored.
Furthermore, because the empty <strong>string</strong> can always be added to a
<strong>TrieWithNoChildren</strong> without constructing a new node, this constructor
should never be passed the empty <strong>string</strong>. The constructor can then
operate as follows:</p><ul><li>If the given <strong>string</strong> is <strong>null</strong>, throw an <strong>ArgumentNullException</strong>.</li><li>If the given <strong>string</strong> is empty or begins with a character that is
not a lower-case English letter, throw an exception.</li><li>Initialize the <strong>bool</strong> field with the given <strong>bool</strong>.</li><li>Initialize the <strong>char</strong> field with the first character of the given
<strong>string</strong>.</li><li>Initialize the <strong>ITrie</strong> field with the result of constructing a new
<strong>TrieWithNoChildren</strong> and adding to it the substring of the given
<strong>string</strong> following the first character.</li></ul><p>The structure of the <strong>Contains</strong> method for the <strong>TrieWithOneChild</strong> class is similar to the <strong>TrieWithManyChildren</strong> class. Specifically, the
empty <strong>string</strong> needs to be handled first (after checking that the <strong>string</strong> isn&rsquo;t <strong>null</strong>) and in exactly the same way,
as the empty <strong>string</strong> is represented in the same way in all three
implementations. Nonempty <strong>string</strong>s, however, are represented
differently, and hence need to be handled differently. For <strong>TrieWithOneChild</strong>, we need to check to
see if the first character of the given <strong>string</strong> matches the child&rsquo;s
label. If so, we can recursively look for the remainder of the
<strong>string</strong> in that child. Otherwise, we should simply return <strong>false</strong>,
as this <strong>string</strong> is not in this trie.</p><p>The <strong>Add</strong> method for <strong>TrieWithOneChild</strong> will need five cases:</p><ul><li>A <strong>null string</strong>: This case can be handled in the same way as for <strong>TrieWithManyChildren</strong>.</li><li>The empty <strong>string</strong>: This case can be handled in the same way as
for <strong>TrieWithManyChildren</strong>.</li><li>A nonempty <strong>string</strong> whose first character is not a lower-case letter: An exception should be thrown.</li><li>A nonempty <strong>string</strong> whose first character matches the child&rsquo;s
label: The remainder of the <strong>string</strong> can be added to the child
using the child&rsquo;s <strong>Add</strong> method. Because this method may return a
different node, we need to replace the child with the value this
method returns. We can then return <strong>this</strong>, as we didn&rsquo;t need more
room for the given <strong>string</strong>.</li><li>A nonempty <strong>string</strong> whose first character is a lower-case letter but does not match the
child&rsquo;s label. In this case, we need to return a new
<strong>TrieWithManyChildren</strong> containing the given <strong>string</strong> and all of
the information already being stored.</li></ul><p>The <strong>TrieWithNoChildren</strong> class is the simplest of the three, as we don&rsquo;t need to worry about any children. The only <strong>private</strong> field it needs is a <strong>bool</strong> to indicate whether it stores the empty string. Its <strong>Contains</strong> method needs to handle <strong>null</strong> or empty strings in the same way as for the other two classes, but because a <strong>TrieWithNoChildren</strong> cannot contain a nonempty string, this method can simply return <strong>false</strong> when it is given a nonempty string.</p><p>The <strong>Add</strong> method for <strong>TrieWithNoChildren</strong> will need to handle a <strong>null</strong> or
empty <strong>string</strong> in the same way as the the other two classes. However,
this implementation cannot store a nonempty <strong>string</strong>. In this case, it
will need to construct and return a new <strong>TrieWithOneChild</strong> containing
the <strong>string</strong> to be added and the <strong>bool</strong> stored in this node.</p><p>Code that uses such a trie will need to refer to it as an <strong>ITrie</strong>
whenever possible. The only exception to this rule occurs when we are
constructing a new trie, as we cannot construct an instance of an
interface. Here, we want to construct the simplest implementation &mdash; a
<strong>TrieWithNoChildren</strong>. Otherwise, the only difference in usage as
compared to the implementation of <a href=/cis300/trees/tries/intro/>the previous
section</a> is that the
<strong>Add</strong> method now returns the resulting trie, whose root may be a
different object; hence, we will need to be sure to replace the current
trie with whatever the <strong>Add</strong> method returns.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><div hidden><h1 id=traversing-a-trie>Traversing a Trie</h1></div><h2 id=traversing-a-trie>Traversing a Trie</h2><p>As with other kinds of trees, there are occasions where we need to
process all the elements stored in a trie in order. Here, the elements
are strings, which are not stored explicitly in the trie, but implicitly
based on the labels of various nodes. Thus, an individual node does not
contain a <strong>string</strong>; however, if its <strong>bool</strong> has a value of <strong>true</strong>,
then the path to that node describes a string stored in the trie. We can
therefore associate this string with this node. Note that this string is
a prefix of any string associated with any node in any of this node&rsquo;s
children; hence, it is alphabetically less than any string found in any
of the children. Thus, in order to process each of the strings in
alphabetic order, we need to do a <a href=/cis300/trees/tries/intro/>preorder
traversal</a>, which
processes the root before recursively processing the children.</p><p>In order to process the string associated with a node, we need to be
able to retrieve this string. Because we will have followed the path
describing this string in order to get to the node associated with it,
we can build this string on the way to the node and pass it as a
parameter to the preorder traversal of the trie rooted at this node.
Because we will be building this string a character at a time, to do
this efficiently we should use a
<a href=/cis300/strings/stringbuilders/><strong>StringBuilder</strong></a>
instead of a <strong>string</strong>. Thus, the preorder traversal method for a trie
will take a <strong>StringBuilder</strong> parameter describing the path to that
trie, in addition to any other parameters needed to process the strings
associated with its nodes.</p><p>Before we present the algorithm itself, we need to address one more
important issue. We want the <strong>StringBuilder</strong> parameter to describe the
path to the node we are currently working on. Because we will need to do
a recursive call on each child, we will need to modify the
<strong>StringBuilder</strong> to reflect the path to that child. In order to be able
to do this, we will need to ensure that the recursive calls don&rsquo;t change
the contents of the <strong>StringBuilder</strong> (or more precisely, that they undo
any changes that they make).</p><p>Because we are implementing a preorder traversal, the first thing we
will need to do is to process the root. This involves determining
whether the root is associated with a string contained in the trie, and
if so, processing that string. Determining whether the root is
associated with a contained string is done by checking the <strong>bool</strong> at
the root. If it is <strong>true</strong>, we can convert the <strong>StringBuilder</strong>
parameter to a <strong>string</strong> and process it by doing whatever processing
needs to be done for each string in our specific application.</p><p>Once we have processed the root, we need to recursively process each of
the children in alphabetic order of their labels. How we accomplish this
depends on how we are implementing the trie - we will assume the
implementation of <a href=/cis300/trees/tries/multiple-impl/>the previous
section</a>. Because
this implementation uses three different classes depending on how many
children a node has, we will need to write three different versions of
the preorder traversal, one for each class. Specifically, after processing the root:</p><ul><li>For a <strong>TrieWithNoChildren</strong>, there is nothing more to do.</li><li>Because a <strong>TrieWithOneChild</strong> has exactly one child, we need a
single recursive call on this child. Before we make this call, we
will need to append the child&rsquo;s label to the <strong>StringBuilder</strong>.
Following the recursive call, we will need to remove the character
that we added by reducing its
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.stringbuilder.length?view=net-6.0#system-text-stringbuilder-length" rel=external target=_blank><strong>Length</strong></a>
property by 1.</li><li>We handle a <strong>TrieWithManyChildren</strong> in a similar way as a
<strong>TrieWithOneChild</strong>, only we will need to iterate through the
array of children and process each non-<strong>null</strong> child with a
recursive call. Note that for each of these children, its label will
need to be appended to the <strong>StringBuilder</strong> prior to the recursive
call and removed immediately after. We can obtain the label of a
child by adding the first letter of the alphabet to its array index and
<a href=/cis300/stacks-queues/stacks/#cast>casting</a> the result to a
<strong>char</strong>.</li></ul><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><div hidden><h1 id=tries-in-word-games>Tries in Word Games</h1></div><h2 id=tries-in-word-games>Tries in Word Games</h2><p>One application of tries is for implementing word games such as
Boggle® or Scrabble®. This section discusses how a trie can be
used to reduce dramatically the amount of time spent searching for words
in such games. We will focus specifically on Boggle, but the same
principles apply to other word games as well.</p><p>A Boggle game consists of either 16 or 25 dice with letters on their
faces, along with a tray containing a 4 x 4 or 5 x 5 grid
for holding these dice. The face of each die contains a single letter,
except that one face of one die contains &ldquo;Qu&rdquo;. The tray has a large
cover such that the dice can be placed in the cover and the tray placed
upside-down on top of the cover. The whole thing can then be shaken,
then inverted so that each die ends up in a different grid cell, forming
a random game board such as:</p><p><a href=#R-image-413e79ebaffa2f1ba8e09791d6e17b14 class=lightbox-link><img alt="A Boggle game board" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis300/trees/tries/word-games/boggle.jpg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

compete to try to form as many unique words as they can from these
letters. The letters of a word must be adjacent either horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally, and no die may be used more than once in a
single word. There is a minimum word length, and longer words are worth
more points. For example, the above game board contains the words,
&ldquo;WITCH&rdquo;, &ldquo;ITCH&rdquo;, &ldquo;PELLET&rdquo;, &ldquo;TELL&rdquo;, and &ldquo;DATA&rdquo;, among many others.</p><p><a href=#R-image-5de6b00e79069eb64e677cda3f2bcaf4 class=lightbox-link><img alt="Words on a Boggle game board" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis300/trees/tries/word-games/boggle2.jpg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

opponent. The program would need to look for words on a given board. The
dictionary of valid words can of course be stored in a trie. In what follows,
we will show how the structure of a trie can be particularly helpful in
guiding this search so that words are found more quickly.</p><p>We can think of a search from a given starting point as a traversal of a
tree. The root of the tree is the starting point, and its children are
searches starting from adjacent dice. We must be careful, however, to
include in such a tree only those adjacent dice that do not already
occur on the path to the given die. For example, if we start a search at
the upper-left corner of the above board, its children would be the
three adjacent dice containing &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;C&rdquo;, and &ldquo;A&rdquo;. The children of &ldquo;I&rdquo;,
then, would not include &ldquo;H&rdquo; because it is already on the path to &ldquo;I&rdquo;.
Part of this tree would look like this:</p><p><a href=#R-image-8801a0d561ed1e5bfc67d77ad9339e9b class=lightbox-link><img alt="A part of a tree representing a Boggle search space" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis300/trees/tries/word-games/boggle-tree.jpg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>
<a href=javascript:history.back(); class=lightbox-back id=R-image-8801a0d561ed1e5bfc67d77ad9339e9b><img alt="A part of a tree representing a Boggle search space" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading=lazy src=/cis300/trees/tries/word-games/boggle-tree.jpg></a></p><p>Note that this tree is not a data structure - it need not be explicitly
stored anywhere. Rather, it is a mathematical object that helps us to
design an algorithm for finding all of the words. Each word on the board
is simply a path in this tree starting from the root. We can therefore
traverse this tree in much the same way as we outlined in <a href=/cis300/trees/tries/traversing/>the previous
section</a> for tries.
For each node in the tree, we can look up the path leading to that node,
and output it if it is a word in the dictionary.</p><p>In order to be able to implement such a traversal, we need to be able to
find the children of a node. These children are the adjacent cells that
are not used in the path to the node. An efficient way to keep track of
the cells used in this path is with a <strong>bool[ , ]</strong> of the same
size as the Boggle board - a value of <strong>true</strong> in this array will
indicate that the corresponding cell on the board has been used in the
current path. The children of a node are then the adjacent cells whose
entries in this array are <strong>false</strong>.</p><p>A preorder traversal of this tree will therefore need the following
parameters (and possibly others, depending on how we want to output the
words found):</p><ul><li>The row index of the current cell.</li><li>The column index of the current cell.</li><li>The <strong>bool[ , ]</strong> described above. The current cell will
have a <strong>false</strong> entry in this array.</li><li>A <strong>StringBuilder</strong> giving the letters on the path up to, but not
including, the current cell.</li></ul><p>The preorder traversal will first need to update the cells used by
setting the location corresponding to the current cell to <strong>true</strong>.
Likewise, it will need to update the <strong>StringBuilder</strong> by appending the
contents of the current cell. Then it will need to process the root by
looking up the contents of the <strong>StringBuilder</strong> - if this forms a word,
it should output this word. Then it should process the children: for
each adjacent cell whose entry in the <strong>bool[ , ]</strong> is
<strong>false</strong>, it should make a recursive call on that cell. After all the
children have been processed, it will need to return the
<strong>bool[ , ]</strong> and the <strong>StringBuilder</strong> to their
earlier states by setting the array entry back to <strong>false</strong> and removing
the character(s) appended earlier.</p><p>Once such a method is written, we can call it once for each cell on the
board. For each of these calls, all entries in the <strong>bool[ , ]</strong>
should be false, and the <strong>StringBuilder</strong> should be empty.</p><p>While the algorithm described above will find all the words on a Boggle
board, a 5 x 5 board will require quite a while for the algorithm
to process. While this might be acceptable if we are implementing a game
that humans can compete with, from an algorithmic standpoint, we would
like to improve the performance. (In fact, there are probably better
ways to make a program with which humans can compete, as this search
will only find words that begin near the top of the board.)</p><p>We can begin to see how to improve the performance if we observe the
similarity between the trees we have been discussing and a trie
containing the word list. Consider, for example, a portion of the child
labeled &lsquo;h&rsquo; in a trie representing a large set of words:</p><p><a href=#R-image-f8958eaacb15caecfb7c66a2e30fdf5e class=lightbox-link><img alt="A portion of a trie." class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis300/trees/tries/word-games/trie-portion.jpg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>
<a href=javascript:history.back(); class=lightbox-back id=R-image-f8958eaacb15caecfb7c66a2e30fdf5e><img alt="A portion of a trie." class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading=lazy src=/cis300/trees/tries/word-games/trie-portion.jpg></a></p><p>We have omitted some of the children because they are irrelevant to the
search we are performing (e.g., there is no die containing &ldquo;E&rdquo; adjacent
to &ldquo;H&rdquo; on the above game board). Also, we are assuming a minimum word
length of 4; hence, &ldquo;ha&rdquo;, &ldquo;hi&rdquo;, and &ldquo;hit&rdquo; are not shown as words in this
trie.</p><p>Notice the similarity between the trie portion shown above and the tree
shown earlier. The root of the tree has children representing dice
containing &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;A&rdquo;, and the former node has children representing
dice containing &ldquo;T&rdquo;, &ldquo;C&rdquo;, and &ldquo;A&rdquo;; likewise, though they are listed in a
different order, the trie has children labeled &lsquo;i&rsquo; and &lsquo;a&rsquo;, and the
former node has children labeled &rsquo;t&rsquo;, &lsquo;c&rsquo;, and &lsquo;a&rsquo;.</p><p>What is more important to our discussion, however, is that the trie does
not have a child labeled &lsquo;c&rsquo;, as there is no English word beginning with
&ldquo;hc&rdquo;. Similarly, the child labeled &lsquo;i&rsquo; does not have a child labeled
&lsquo;i&rsquo;, as there is no English word beginning with &ldquo;hii&rdquo;. If there are no
words in the word list beginning with these prefixes, there is no need
to search the subtrees rooted at the corresponding nodes when doing the
preorder traversal. Using the trie to prune the search in this way ends
up avoiding many subtrees that don&rsquo;t lead to any words. As a result,
only a small fraction of the original tree is searched.</p><p>In order to take advantage of the trie in this way, we need a method in
the trie implementation to return the child having a given label, or
<strong>null</strong> if there is no such child. Alternatively, we might provide a
method that takes a <strong>string</strong> and returns the trie that this <strong>string</strong>
leads to, or <strong>null</strong> if there is no such trie (this method would make
it easier to handle the die containing &ldquo;Qu&rdquo;). Either way, we can then
traverse the trie as we are doing the preorder traversal described
above, and avoid searching a subtree whenever the trie becomes null.</p><p>This revised preorder traversal needs an extra parameter - a trie giving
all completions of words beginning with the prefix given by the
<strong>StringBuilder</strong> parameter. We will need to ensure that this parameter
is never <strong>null</strong>. The algorithm then proceeds as follows:</p><ul><li>From the given trie, get the subtrie containing the completions of
words beginning with the contents of the current cell.</li><li>If this subtrie is not <strong>null</strong>:<ul><li>Set the location in the <strong>bool[ , ]</strong> corresponding to
the current cell to <strong>true</strong>.</li><li>Append the contents of the current cell to the
<strong>StringBuilder</strong>.</li><li>If the subtrie obtained above contains the empty <strong>string</strong>,
output the contents of the <strong>StringBuilder</strong> as a word found.</li><li>Recursively traverse each adjacent cell whose corresponding
entry in the <strong>bool[ , ]</strong> is <strong>false</strong>. The recursive
calls should use the subtrie obtained above.</li><li>Set the location in the <strong>bool[ , ]</strong> corresponding to
the current cell to <strong>false</strong>.</li><li>Remove the contents of the current cell from the end of the
<strong>StringBuilder</strong> (i.e., decrease its <strong>Length</strong> by the
appropriate amount).</li></ul></li></ul><p>We would then apply the above algorithm to each cell on the board. For
each cell, we would use a <strong>bool[ , ]</strong> whose entries are all
<strong>false</strong>, an empty <strong>StringBuilder</strong>, and the entire trie of valid words. Note that we
have designed the preorder traversal so that it leaves each of these
parameters unchanged; hence, we only need to initialize them once. The
resulting search will find all of the words on the board quickly.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></section></div></main><div class=git-footer><p class=theme-version-footer>6.0.0</p><p>Last modified by:
