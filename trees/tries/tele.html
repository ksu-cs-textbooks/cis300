However, there are special cases where we can achieve better performance. One of these special cases occurs when we need to store a list of words, as we might need in a word game, for example. For such applications, a <em>trie</em> provides for even more efficient storage and retrieval.</p><p>In this section, we first define a trie and give a rather straightforward implementation. We then show how to improve performance by implementing different nodes in different ways. We then examine the use of a preorder traversal to traverse a trie. We conclude by discussing an example of using a trie in a word game.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div></div><script src=/cis300/js/clipboard.min.js?1723840627 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1723840627 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/theme.js?1723840627 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/tele-scroll.js?1723840627 defer></script></body></html>
