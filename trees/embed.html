However, inserting or removing from an array-like structure can be expensive because all subsequent data elements must be moved to accommodate the change. On the other hand, linked lists can be modified efficiently, provided we have a reference to the cell preceding the insertion or deletion point. However, finding a cell can be expensive because the only way to search a linked list is to start at the front and work through it a cell at a time. We would like a data structure that provides both efficient lookups and efficient insertions and deletions.</p><p>To meet this challenge, we want a linked structure so that changes can be made cheaply by changing a few references. However, we want the individual cells in the structure to be arranged in a way that supports something like a binary search. The specific structure that we want is called a binary search tree, which is a particular kind of tree.
In this chapter, we will examine various kinds of trees. We will start by defining trees and developing a strategy for processing them. We will then present binary search trees, which will provide a partial solution to our challenge of finding a data structure to support efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions. However, there will be cases in which binary search trees have poor performance. We will therefore give a refinement known as AVL trees, which give good performance in all cases. We will then examine two other uses of trees - tries and priority queues.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div><script>window.MathJax=Object.assign(window.MathJax||{},{tex:{inlineMath:[["\\(","\\)"],["$","$"]],displayMath:[["\\[","\\]"],["$$","$$"]]},options:{enableMenu:!1}},JSON.parse("{}"))</script><script id=MathJax-script async src=/cis300/js/mathjax/tex-mml-chtml.js?1768891883></script><script src=/cis300/js/clipboard/clipboard.min.js?1768891883 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/perfect-scrollbar/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1768891883 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/theme.min.js?1768891883 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/embed-iframe.min.js?1768891883 defer></script></body></html>
