For example, consider a C# compiler. Matching parentheses (( and )), brackets ([ and ]), and braces ({ and }) delimit various parts of the source code. In order for these parts to be interpreted correctly, the compiler must be able to determine how these different kinds of parentheses match up with each other. Another example is processing structured data stored in XML format. Different parts of such a data set are delimited by nested begin tags like &lt;summary> and end tags like &lt;/summary> (documentation comments in C# code are in XML format). These tags are essentially different kinds of parentheses that need to be matched.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/stacks-queues/paren/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
