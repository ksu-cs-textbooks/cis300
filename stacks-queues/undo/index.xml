By right-clicking on a TextBox, a popup menu containing an Undo entry is presented. This Undo will undo only one action, which may include several edits. An immediate subsequent Undo will undo the Undo - in essence, a Redo. The same behavior can be achieved using Ctrl+Z. A more powerful Undo/Redo feature would allow an arbitrary sequence of edits to be undone, with the option of redoing any of these Undo operations.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/stacks-queues/undo/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
