For example, the implementations of both System.Collections.Stack and System.Collections.Generic.Stack&lt;T> use this technique. This implementation uses an array to store the elements of the stack, and is quite similar to the StringBuilder implementation we described in the last chapter. We have discussed two kinds of stacks in this chapter - stacks of object?s and generic stacks.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/stacks-queues/stack-impl/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
