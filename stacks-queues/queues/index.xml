Consider, for example, the computation of capital gains from stock sales. Typically an investor will buy shares of a stock commodity at various times and for different prices. When shares are sold, the amount of money received doesn’t depend on which shares of a given commodity are sold, as each share is worth the same amount at that time. Likewise, the unsold shares of that commodity each have the same value. However, for accounting purposes, it does matter.
