## Office Hours Calendar

Below is a calendar showing the office hours for the semester. You can access it from any calendar application that supports the iCal format with the following link https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/gubep1p76upkafhip0skfj0n7s%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics.

<iframe style="border-width: 0;" src="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?mode=WEEK&amp;height=600&amp;wkst=1&amp;bgcolor=%23FFFFFF&amp;src=gubep1p76upkafhip0skfj0n7s%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;color=%231B887A&amp;ctz=America%2FChicago" width="800" height="600" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms allow-same-origin"></iframe>

In order to manage office hours during busy times, we will use an online queueing system. If everyone holding office hours is busy when you're needing their help, add yourself to the queue using the following link:

[CIS 300 Help Queue](https://officehours.cs.ksu.edu/groupsession/2) 


You will then be notified via Microsoft Teams when someone is ready to help you. At that point, you may go to their posted office location.Â Important: When you enter the help queue, be sure to open Microsoft Teams, either the [web app](https://teams.microsoft.com/) or the [desktop/mobile app](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app).

## Required Textbook

[*Data Structures in C#* ](https://cis300.cs.ksu.edu/), Rod Howell.

## Prerequisite

The prerequisites for this course are CIS 200 and either MATH 205 or  MATH 220. A grade of a C or better is required for each prerequisite. If you do not meet the prerequisite requirement for this course, you  should see me immediately, or you will be dropped from the course.

## Learning Outcomes

Students should attain competence in:

- Using interfaces to (partially) define a data structure
- Implementing and using standard versions of classic data structures: lists, stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables
- Implementing and using elementary algorithms for searching and manipulating a data structure
- Using recursion, including recursive definitions of data structures like lists and trees
- Using and implementing algorithms for sorting
- Understanding performance differences between various algorithms and data structures

## Programming Environment

The development environment to be used in this class is Microsoft  Visual Studio 2022. This software is available on the Windows machines  in the public labs in Engineering Hall 1114, 1116, and 1118, as well as  certain other public labs on campus. Please note that some of these labs are reserved for classroom use at certain times of the day - be sure to check the schedules posted by the doors.

If you wish to install the software on your own PC, you can download  it for free from the Microsoft Azure Portal. Please refer to "[Installing Visual Studio](https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/appendix/vs/installing-vs/)" for more details.

## Grading

- Review Quizzes: 5%
- Lab assignments: 15%
- Homework assignments: 30%
- Exams: 50%

### Review Quizzes

Prior to each lab (typically at 4:30 pm on the day of the previous lab), a video, readings, and a review quiz over these materials will be made available. This review quiz will be due at the beginning of the lab time. For example, the materials and review quiz for Lab 2 will be made available at 4:30 pm on Mon., Aug. 19, and the review quiz will be due at 11:30 am on Wed., Aug. 21. The main purpose of these quizzes is to help prepare you for the in-class discussion and the lab assignment for the day on which the quiz is due. You will be allowed to take each quiz up to twice, and the higher grade will be recorded.

### Lab Assignments

One lab assignment will be assigned during each lab session. These  assignments will each be due at the end of the lab time. Each lab  assignment will be worth 2 points:

- 1 point for making a legitimate attempt at completing the assignment.
- 1 point for fully implementing correct functionality.

**You must do the lab assignment in the lab classroom during  the lab period in which it is published in order to receive credit for  it.** The lowest five lab scores will not be counted toward your final grade - no other lab absences will be excused.

### Homework Assignments

Five programming assignments will be given as homework during the course of the semester. All solutions must be submitted electronically by the given due date. Late submissions will be accepted with a penalty of 1% per hour, or any portion of an hour, late; thus, if a submission is 1 minute late, the penalty is 1%. If multiple solutions are submitted for the same assignment, only the last one will be graded. No submissions will be accepted after three days (i.e., 72 hours) past the due date.

Each of the first four homework assignments will be worth 5% of the final grade. The fifth homework assignment will be a final project worth 10% of the final grade. The final project will take the place of a Final Exam.

### Exams

Exams will be given on the following dates:

- Fri., Sept. 20
- Wed., Oct. 23
- Fri., Nov. 22

Each exam will be a 55-minute exam beginning at 11:30am in place of a lab assignment for that day. They will each be worth one sixth (approx. 16.7%) of the final grade. Each exam will consist entirely of writing code. **Except under extreme circumstances (as judged by me), no make-up exams will be given.**

#### Grading Scale

Final grades will be assigned according to the following scale:

- 90%-100%: A
- 80%-89%: B
- 70%-79%: C
- 60%-69%: D
- Below 60%: F

## Course Delivery

Details regarding the delivery of this course are given in the [Course Introduction](https://k-state.instructure.com/courses/162567/modules/681997) module. In order to make sure you understand the delivery mechanisms, you must obtain a perfect score on the quiz in that module before you can begin the course material. You can take this quiz as many times as  you need to get a perfect score. The score will **not** count toward your final grade. 

## Canvas

All assignments and other course materials will be distributed via [Canvas ](http://canvas.ksu.edu). Grade information may be accessed there, and announcements will be  posted from time to time. Important class messages will be emailed to  your KSU email addresses and posted as announcements. **You must be enrolled in the course to access Canvas.**

## How to Succeed in This Course


- **Prepare for labs**. Preparatory videos, readings, slides, and a review quiz will be available for each lab assignment. Taking some time to familiarize yourself with the material prior to the lab time will help you to do well on the review quizzes and lab assignments, as well as to learn more from the lab experience.
- **Take the review quizzes**. These are due before the labs and will help to reinforce the preparatory materials. Taking the review quizzes will help you to learn the material and do well on the lab assignments and exams. Because you can take each quiz twice, if necessary, you should be able to earn all (or nearly all) of the points from these quizzes.
- **Complete the lab assignments**. We expect you to be able to complete these assignments correctly. Thus, you should be able to earn all (or nearly all) of the points from lab assignments for the semester. Furthermore, what you learn from this experience will help you to do well on the homework and the exams.
- **Don't be afraid to ask for help**. While there is value in figuring things out on your own, sometimes a little help can go a long way. If you seem to be stuck on something (particularly on a lab assignment), or if something in the instructions doesn't make sense to you, ask for help from me or one of the lab assistants - that's what we're there for. 
- **Prepare for the exams**. Following each lab, review the learning outcomes posted for that lab and make sure you understand what you should have learned. Also pay attention to the review quizzes. On the exams, you will be applying what you were expected to have learned in the labs.
- **Start homework assignments early**. Programming usually takes longer than you expect. Homework assignments will require much more time than lab assignments. Starting early will help you to complete the assignments on time.
- **Review model solutions**. Even if you completed the assignment, seeing how we did it can help you to learn more.
