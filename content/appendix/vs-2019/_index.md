## Visual Studio Enterprise 2019

This chapter will guide you through the use of Visual Studio 2019 and
GitHub to obtain start code for your assignments, build, test, and debug
graphical applications and class libraries, and submit assignment
solutions. No attempt is meant to be exhaustive, as many of the features
of Visual Studio are beyond the scope of CIS 300.
