## Programming Style Requirements

Software companies typically have programming style requirements to which their programmers must adhere. Many of these requirements have become industry standards. These requirements help to make the developed code more readable, portable, and maintainable. This appendix contains a short set (much shorter than what is typically found in industry) of programming style requirements for CIS 300. These requirements are consistent with [Microsoft's Naming Guidelines](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229002.aspx) and de facto industry accepted practices. Other requirements are simplifications introduced due to the fact that this programming is for course assignments, rather than for distribution. All assignments in CIS 300 use the package [KSU.CS.CodeAnalyzers](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KSU.CS.CodeAnalyzers/1.0.3.2?_src=template) to assist with meeting many of these requirements. This package will generate warnings when various style requirements are violated. All code submitted for grading is expected to follow these style requirements and to be free of warnings.
