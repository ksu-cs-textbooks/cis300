Software companies typically have programming style requirements to
which their programmers must adhere. Many of these requirements have
become industry standards. These requirements help to make the developed
code more readable, portable, and maintainable. This appendix contains a
short set (much shorter than what is typically found in industry) of
programming style requirements for CIS 300. Most of these requirements
are derived from a [style guide posted at Pete
Brown's 10rem.net](http://10rem.net/articles/net-naming-conventions-and-programming-standards---best-practices);
that guide is consistent with [Microsoft's Naming
Guidelines](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229002.aspx) and
de facto industry accepted practices. Other requirements are
simplifications introduced due to the fact that this programming is for
course assignments, rather than for distribution.
