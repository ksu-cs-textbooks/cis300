The only setup required for using Git with GitHub in this class is to sign up for a GitHub account. To do this, first navigate to [GitHub](http://github.com). There, you will be presented with a sign-up form - fill in the three boxes and click the "Sign up for GitHub" button. You will then be shown a "Welcome" page, which you can dismiss by clicking the "Continue" button at the bottom. You will then be presented with a form requesting various information - provide any information you feel comfortable giving, or provide no information at all by clicking "skip this step".

Once you have completed the sign-up process, you will be taken to your home page for your GitHub account. Here, you should edit your profile to contain at least your real name. To get to your profile, find the two drop-down menus at the top right - one is labeled with a "+", and the other with a random design. Click the one with a random design and select "Your profile". Click the "Edit profile" button and edit your profile to contain your name and whatever other information you want to provide. Finish editing by clicking the "Update profile" button.

At some point, GitHub will send an email to the address you used when signing up. This email will ask you to verify your email address by clicking on the "Verify email address" link in that message. After you have done this, you will be able to set up Git repositories, as described in the next section.
