# Strings and StringBuilders
C# and the .NET Framework provides two data structures for representing
sequences of characters - **string**s and **StringBuilder**s. Each of
these data structures has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this
chapter, we will examine how these two types are used and implemented.
In the process, we will note the tradeoffs involved in using one or the
other.
