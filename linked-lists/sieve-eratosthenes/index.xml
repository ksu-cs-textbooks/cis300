Thus, $ 2 $, $ 3 $, and $ 5 $ are prime, but not $ 1 $ (it is not greater than $ 1 $) or $ 4 $ (it is divisible by $ 2 $). Because every integer is divisible by itself and $ 1 $, we will call any other positive factors nontrivial factors; thus, a prime number is an integer greater than $ 1 $ that has no nontrivial factors.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/linked-lists/sieve-eratosthenes/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
