Thus, $ 2 $, $ 3 $, and $ 5 $ are prime, but not $ 1 $ (it is not greater than $ 1 $) or $ 4 $ (it is divisible by $ 2 $). Because every integer is divisible by itself and $ 1 $, we will call any other positive factors nontrivial factors; thus, a prime number is an integer greater than $ 1 $ that has no nontrivial factors. The study of prime numbers dates back to at least the third century BC. One of the earliest known algorithms finds all prime numbers less than a given integer $ n $. This algorithm is known as the Sieve of Eratosthenes, and is attributed to the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes of Cyrene (c. 276 BC - c. 194 BC).</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/linked-lists/sieve-eratosthenes/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
