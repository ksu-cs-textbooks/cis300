With this chapter, we begin a study of data structures that use reference types in a powerful way. Rather than forming sequences by placing data items in adjacent cells of an array, we instead use references to chain data elements together in a sequence. For some applications, this ends up being more efficient than using an array.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/linked-lists/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><item><title>Introduction to Linked Lists</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/linked-lists/intro/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/linked-lists/intro/</guid><description>Introduction to Linked Lists To build a linked list, we first need to define a simple class, which we will call LinkedListCell&lt;T>. Instances of this class will be the individual building blocks that we will chain together to form linked lists. T will be the type of the data item we will store in each cell - i.e., the type of the data items that we will store in the linked list.</description></item><item><title>Implementing Stacks and Queues with Linked Lists</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/linked-lists/stacks-queues/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/linked-lists/stacks-queues/</guid><description>Implementing Stacks and Queues with Linked Lists Because linked lists store data elements in linear sequences, they can be used to give alternative implementations of stacks and queues. One advantage to using linked lists is that we donâ€™t have to worry about filling up something like an array - we can just keep allocating cells as long as we need to (unless we run out of memory).
Implementing a stack using a linked list is particularly easy because all accesses to a stack are at the top.</description></item><item><title>Finding Prime Numbers</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/linked-lists/sieve-eratosthenes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/linked-lists/sieve-eratosthenes/</guid><description>Finding Prime Numbers An integer greater than $ 1 $ is said to be prime if it is not divisible by any positive integers other than itself and $ 1 $. Thus, $ 2 $, $ 3 $, and $ 5 $ are prime, but not $ 1 $ (it is not greater than $ 1 $) or $ 4 $ (it is divisible by $ 2 $). Because every integer is divisible by itself and $ 1 $, we will call any other positive factors nontrivial factors; thus, a prime number is an integer greater than $ 1 $ that has no nontrivial factors.</description></item></channel></rss>
