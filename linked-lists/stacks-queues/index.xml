One advantage to using linked lists is that we donâ€™t have to worry about filling up something like an array - we can just keep allocating cells as long as we need to (unless we run out of memory).
Implementing a stack using a linked list is particularly easy because all accesses to a stack are at the top.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/linked-lists/stacks-queues/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
