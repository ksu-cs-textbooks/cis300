One advantage to using linked lists is that we don’t have to worry about filling up something like an array - we can just keep allocating cells as long as we need to (unless we run out of memory).
Implementing a stack using a linked list is particularly easy because all accesses to a stack are at the top. One end of a linked list, the beginning, is always directly accessible. We should therefore arrange the elements so that the top element of the stack is at the beginning of the linked list, and the bottom element of the stack is at the end of the linked list. We can represent an empty stack with null.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/linked-lists/stacks-queues/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
