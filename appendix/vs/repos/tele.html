Git is a <em>source control</em> system integrated into Visual Studio 2022. Source control systems are powerful mechanisms for teams of programmers and other collaborators to manage multiple copies of various source files and other documents that all collaborators may be modifying. While CIS 300 does not involve teamwork, source control provides a convenient mechanism for distribution of code and submission of assignment solutions. In addition, as we will discuss later, source control provides mechanisms for <a href=/cis300/appendix/vs/multiple/>accessing your code on multiple machines</a> and for <a href=/cis300/appendix/vs/checkpointing/>&ldquo;checkpointing&rdquo; your code</a>.</p><p>At the heart of Git is the concept of a Git repository. A Git
repository is essentially a folder on your local machine. As you make
changes within this folder, Git tracks these changes. From time to
time, you will <em>commit</em> these changes. If you see that you have gone
down a wrong path, you can revert to an earlier commit. Git
repositories may be hosted on a server such as GitHub. Various users
may have copies of a Git repository on their own local machines. Git
provides tools for synchronizing local repositories with the
repository hosted on the server in a consistent way.</p><div class="box notices cstyle note"><div class=box-label><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Note</div><div class=box-content><p>The above description is a bit of an oversimplification, as the folder
comprising a local copy of a repository typically contains some files
and/or folders that are not part of the repository. One example of
such &ldquo;extra&rdquo; files might be
executables that are generated whenever source code within the
repository is compiled. However, when Visual Studio is managing a Git
repository, it does a good job of including within the repository any
files the user
places within the folder comprising the repository.</p></div></div><p>For each lab and homework assignment in CIS 300, you will be provided a URL that will create your own private Git repository on GitHub. The only people who will have access to your GitHub repositories are you, the CIS 300 instructors, and the CIS 300 lab assistants. These repositories will initially contain start code and perhaps data files for the respective assignments. You will copy the repository to your local machine by cloning it. When you are finished with the assignment, you will push the repository back to GitHub and submit its URL for grading. In what follows, we will explain how to create and clone a GitHub repository. Later in this chapter, we will explain how to commit changes, push a repository, and use some of the other features of Git.</p><p>Before you can access GitHub, you will need a GitHub account. If you don&rsquo;t already have one, you can sign up for one at <a href=https://github.com rel=external target=_blank>github.com</a>. At some point after you have completed the sign-up process, GitHub will send you an email asking you to verify the email address you provided during the sign-up process. After you have done this, you will be able to set up GitHub repositories.</p><p>For each assignment in CIS 300, you will be given an invitation URL, such as:</p><ul><li><a href=https://classroom.github.com/a/nI3CHScF target=_blank><code>https://classroom.github.com/a/nI3CHScF</code></a></li></ul><p>Over the next few sections, we will be working through a simple example based on the above invitation link. If you wish to work through this example, click on the above link. You may be asked to sign in to GitHub, but once you are signed in, you will be shown a page asking you to accept the assignment. Clicking the &ldquo;Accept this assignment&rdquo; button will create a GitHub repository for you. You will be given a link that will take you to that repository. From that page you will be able to view all of the files in the repository.</p><p>In order to be able to use this repository, you will need to clone it
to your local machine. To do this, first open Visual Studio 2022, and
click on the &ldquo;Clone a Repository&rdquo; button on the right. In your web
browser, navigate to the GitHub repository that you wish to clone, and
click on the &ldquo;Code&rdquo; button. This will display a URL - click on the
button to its right to copy this URL to your clipboard. Then go back
to Visual Studio and paste this URL into the text
box labeled, &ldquo;Repository location&rdquo;. In the text box below that, fill
in a new folder you want to use for this repository on your machine,
then click the &ldquo;Clone&rdquo; button (if you are asked to sign in to GitHub, click the link to sign in through your web browser). This will copy the Git repository from
GitHub into the folder you selected, and open the solution it contains.</p><p>The following sections give an overview of how to use Visual Studio to edit and debug an application, as well as how to use Git within Visual Studio to maintain the local Git repository and synchronize it with the GitHub repository.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div></div><script src=/cis300/js/clipboard.min.js?1737489329 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1737489329 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/theme.js?1737489329 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/tele-scroll.js?1737489329 defer></script></body></html>
