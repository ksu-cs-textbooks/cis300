Before you decide to do this, however, you should consider whether this is the best approach. For example, if you have a CS Account, you have a network file system (the U: drive on CS Windows systems) that you can use whenever you have internet access. From off campus, you need to tunnel into campus using a Virtual Private Network, or VPN (see the KSU Information Technology Services page on Virtual Private Networking for instructions). Once on campus, you can mount this file system as a network drive by following the instructions on the CS support page, “DiskUsage”.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/appendix/vs/multiple/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
