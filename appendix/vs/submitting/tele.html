You will do this through the &ldquo;Git Changes&rdquo; tab in Visual Studio (if you don&rsquo;t see this tab, click the icon that looks like a pencil at the bottom of the
Visual Studio window). In the &ldquo;Git Changes&rdquo; tab, in the box that says &ldquo;Enter a message &lt;Required>&rdquo;, type in a message to be
associated with the changes you are committing.<details open class="box cstyle notices warning"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
Warning</summary><div class=box-content><p>Do <strong>not</strong> check the &ldquo;Amend&rdquo; box. This causes the previous commit to be changed, rather than creating a new commit. If this commit is already on GitHub, you will be unable to push your amended commit.</div></details>Then click &ldquo;Commit
All&rdquo;. A message at the top of the &ldquo;Git Changes&rdquo; tab will indicate whether the commit was successful.</p></li><li><p><strong>Push</strong> your committed changes to GitHub. Do this by clicking the
up-arrow icon at the top of the &ldquo;Git Changes&rdquo; tab. Note that <em>only committed changes will be pushed</em>. A message at the top of the &ldquo;Git Changes&rdquo; tab will indicate whether the push was successful.</p></li><li><p><strong>Submit</strong> the URL of the commit you want graded using the submission
form provided in the assignment instructions. This requires the
following steps:</p><ul><li>Reload the GitHub repository for this assignment in your web
browser, and click on the link showing the number of commits
(this is in the top right corner of the list of files and
folders in the repository). This
will show a list of commits, beginning with the latest. To the
right of each commit is a button labeled &ldquo;&lt;>&rdquo;. This button
links to a web page displaying the entire contents of that
commit. (It&rsquo;s a good idea to check to see that all of your
source code files are present, in case something went wrong.)
The URL of this page will end in a 40-digit hexadecimal number
giving a digital fingerprint of the commit. Copy this <em>entire URL</em> to
the submission form at the bottom of the assignment.</li><li>To complete your submission, click the &ldquo;Submit Assignment&rdquo;
button in the assignment submission form. The time at which
this button was clicked will be the official submission time
for your assignment.</li></ul></li></ol><details open class="box cstyle notices warning"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
Warning</summary><div class=box-content><p>It is important to do all three of these steps in this order. In
particular, if you make any changes between your last commit and the
push, these changes won&rsquo;t be included in the submission. It is also important to include the correct URL.</p></div></details><details open class="box cstyle notices tip"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i>
Tip</summary><div class=box-content><p>You can double-check that all changes have been pushed by looking at
the numbers next to the up-down-arrows and pencil icons at the bottom of the
Visual Studio window. If all changes have been pushed, all numbers
should be 0.</p></div></details><p>Occasionally, problems can occur with the interface between Visual
Studio and GitHub. These problems can prevent your code from being
pushed to GitHub. While the problems can often be fixed, it is often
easier to bypass Visual Studio altogether, and use GitHub&rsquo;s file
upload mechanism.</p><details open class="box cstyle notices warning"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
Warning</summary><div class=box-content><p>This is not the preferred assignment submission procedure because it
is less automated (and hence more error-prone), and it creates a
commit on GitHub that is not in your local git repository. However, it
can be used if the above procedure doesn&rsquo;t work for you.</p></div></details><p>To use this alternative submission procedure, do the following steps:</p><ol><li><p>If Visual Studio is running, exit this application, making sure all files are saved.</p></li><li><p>In your web browser, navigate to the repository for the assignment you are submitting. You should see a list of files and folders, including a file whose name ends with &ldquo;.sln&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>In your Windows file browser, navigate to your project folder for this assignment. You should see the same list of files and folders as is shown in your web browser. (Depending on the settings for your local machine, you may not see file name suffixes such as &ldquo;.sln&rdquo; and &ldquo;.gitignore&rdquo;, and if you&rsquo;ve added any projects that were not in the original repository, their folders may be shown in the file browser but not in the web browser.)</p></li><li><p>In your web browser, click the &ldquo;Add file&rdquo; button in the row of
buttons above the list of files and folders, and select
&ldquo;Upload files&rdquo; from the drop-down menu.</p></li><li><p>In your file browser, type Control-&ldquo;A&rdquo; to select all files and folders, and drag them to the web browser where it says, &ldquo;Drag files here &mldr;&rdquo;. The web browser should indicate a number of files being uploaded.</p></li><li><p>Near the bottom of the web browser window, in the text box below &ldquo;Commit changes&rdquo;, type a commit message, then click the &ldquo;Commit changes&rdquo; at the bottom. It may take a little while to process, but eventually you should see the repository again.</p></li><li><p>Make sure all of your &ldquo;.cs&rdquo; files are present in the GitHub repository, and that they contain the code you want. (If you have removed or renamed any files, the original files may still be in the repository; however, they shouldn&rsquo;t be in the solution, and therefore shouldn&rsquo;t interfere with the program&rsquo;s execution.)</p></li><li><p>Submit the URL of this commit by following Step 3 of the assignment submission process given above.</p></li></ol><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div><script>window.MathJax=Object.assign(window.MathJax||{},{tex:{inlineMath:[["\\(","\\)"],["$","$"]],displayMath:[["\\[","\\]"],["$$","$$"]]},options:{enableMenu:!1}},JSON.parse("{}"))</script><script id=MathJax-script async src=/cis300/js/mathjax/tex-mml-chtml.js?1768892168></script><script src=/cis300/js/clipboard/clipboard.min.js?1768892168 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/perfect-scrollbar/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1768892168 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/theme.min.js?1768892168 defer></script></div><script src=/cis300/js/tele-scroll.min.js?1768892168 defer></script></body></html>
