Source control can help us with this if we checkpoint by committing our changes from time to time, using commit messages that clearly describe the changes made in that commit. (Note that it is not necessary to push these commits to GitHub until you are ready to submit the assignment.) Git’s revert feature allows us to undo any of these commits.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/appendix/vs/checkpointing/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
