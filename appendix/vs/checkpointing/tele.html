Source control can help us with this if we <em>checkpoint</em> by committing our changes from time to time, using commit messages that clearly describe the changes made in that commit. (Note that it is not necessary to push these commits to GitHub until you are ready to submit the assignment.) Git&rsquo;s <em>revert</em> feature allows us to undo any of these commits.</p><p>Before you access Git&rsquo;s revert feature, you should undo any uncommitted changes. To do this, go to the &ldquo;Git Changes&rdquo; tab, right-click on the first line under &ldquo;Changes&rdquo;, and select &ldquo;Undo Changes&rdquo;. You will be asked to confirm this action. This will undo any changes to that folder. If you have more folders containing changes, repeat this process for each changed folder.</p><p>To access Git&rsquo;s revert feature, select &ldquo;View Branch History&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Git&rdquo; menu. This will reveal a list of all the commits for this local Git repository, with the most recent commit listed at the top. To undo all of the changes in any commit, right-click on that commit, and select &ldquo;Revert&rdquo; from the popup menu. The result is automatically committed.</p><div class="box notices cstyle warning"><div class=box-label><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Warning</div><div class=box-content><p>You should always revert commits starting with the most recent and working backwards (i.e., from the top of the list toward the bottom). Otherwise, you will probably encounter conflicts that need to be resolved, as described in <a href=/cis300/appendix/vs/multiple/>the previous section</a>. You may even reach a state in which no commits can be reverted.</p></div></div><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div></div><script src=/cis300/js/clipboard.min.js?1756138921 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1756138921 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/theme.js?1756138921 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/tele-scroll.js?1756138921 defer></script></body></html>
