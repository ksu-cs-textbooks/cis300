      <title>Programming Style Requirements</title>

      <description>Programming Style Requirements Software companies typically have programming style requirements to which their programmers must adhere. Many of these requirements have become industry standards. These requirements help to make the developed code more readable, portable, and maintainable. This appendix contains a short set (much shorter than what is typically found in industry) of programming style requirements for CIS 300. These requirements are consistent with Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Naming Guidelines and de facto industry accepted practices.</description>
