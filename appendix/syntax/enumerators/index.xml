Thus, because Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue> is a subtype of IEnumerable&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;TKey, TValue>>, we can use a foreach loop to iterate through the key-value pairs that it stores. Likewise, because its Keys and Values properties get objects that are subtypes of IEnumerable&lt;TKey> and IEnumerable&lt;TValue>, respectively, foreach loops may be used to iterate through these objects as well, in order to process all the keys or all the values stored in the dictionary. IEnumerable and IEnumerable&lt;T> are interfaces; hence, we must define any subtypes so that they implement these interfaces. In this section, we will show how to implement the IEnumerable&lt;T> interface to support a foreach loop.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/appendix/syntax/enumerators/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
