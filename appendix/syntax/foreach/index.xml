A foreach can be used when all of the following conditions hold:
The data structure is a subtype of either IEnumerable or IEnumerable&lt;T> for some type T. You do not need to know the locations in the data structure of the individual elements. You do not need to modify the data structure with this loop. Warning Many of the data structures provided to you in CIS 300, as well as many that you are to write yourself for this class, are not subtypes of either of the types mentioned in 1 above. Consequently, we cannot use a foreach loop to iterate through any of these data structures. However, most of the data structures provided in the .NET Framework, as well as all arrays, are subtypes of one of these types.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/appendix/syntax/foreach/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
