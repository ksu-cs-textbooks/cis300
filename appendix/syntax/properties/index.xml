For example, the string class contains a public property called Length. This property is accessed in code much as if it were a public int field; i.e., if s is a string variable, we can access its Length property with the expression s.Length, which evaluates to an int. If Length were a public int field, we would access it in just the same way.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/appendix/syntax/properties/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
