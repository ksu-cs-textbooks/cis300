Such declarations are useful for defining a value that is to be used throughout a class or structure definition, or throughout an entire program. For example, we might define:
public class ConstantsExample { public readonly int VerticalPadding = 12; private const string _humanPlayer = "X"; . . . } Subsequently throughout the above class, the identifier _humanPlayer will refer to the string, “X”. Because VerticalPadding is public, the VerticalPadding field of any instance of this ConstantsExample will contain the value 12 throughout the program. Such definitions are useful for various reasons, but perhaps the most important is that they make the program more maintainable. For example, VerticalPadding may represent some distance within a graphical layout. At some point in the lifetime of the software, it may be decided that this distance should be changed to 10 in order to give a more compact layout. Because we are using a readonly field rather than a literal 12 everywhere this distance is needed, we can make this change by simply changing the 12 in the above definition to 10.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/appendix/syntax/const/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
