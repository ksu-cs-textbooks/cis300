Class and structure definitions give instructions for constructing individual objects of various types, normally by using the new keyword. When an object is constructed, it has its own fields in which values may be stored. Specifically, if type T has an int field called _length, then each object of type T will have have such a field, and each of these fields may store a different int. Thus, for example, if x and y are instances of type T, then x._length may contain 7, while y._length may contain 12.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/appendix/syntax/static-this/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
