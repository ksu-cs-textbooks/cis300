Visual Studio® automatically generates some source code files that you will not need to modify — you don’t need to add comments to those files.
At the top of each file in which you provide code, add a comment of the following form:
/* filename.cs * Author: Name */ where filename.cs is the name of the file, and Name is the name of the primary author. The primary author will either be you or, for files provided for you, the name of the original author of that file. Whenever you use someone else’s code, it is important that you give them credit for it. (To fail to do this is plagiarism.) Thus, if one of your source files was originally written by Rod Howell, leave his name as the author. If you have modified a file originally written by someone else, below the Author line, insert a line of the following form:</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/appendix/style/comments/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
