Visual Studio® automatically generates some source code files that you will not need to modify — you don’t need to add comments to those files.
At the top of each file in which you provide code, add a comment of the following form:
/* filename.cs * Author: Name */where filename.cs is the name of the file, and Name is the name of the primary author.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/appendix/style/comments/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
