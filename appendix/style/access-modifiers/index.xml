For simplicity, however, we will not allow the use of the internal or protected access modifiers unless they are required by the compiler (for example, when overriding a protected method).
When classes, fields, etc., are declared, C# does not require that an access modifier be used. If the access modifier is omitted, a default accessibility level will be used. However, the default depends on where it is being declared. For example, the default accessibility level of a top-level type is internal, whereas the default accessibility level of a class member is private. In order to avoid confusion, we will require that access modifiers (i.e., public or private) be used on all declarations except where C# does not allow them (C# does not allow access modifiers for namespaces, members of interfaces or enumerations, or local variables within methods). In particular, note that when Visual Studio® automatically generates a class statement, it does not always supply an access modifier, or it may use internal. We require that the statement be changed to use public (C# does not allow private here).</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/appendix/style/access-modifiers/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
