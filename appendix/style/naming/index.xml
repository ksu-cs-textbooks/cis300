Pascal case: Multiple words are joined without spaces, using capital letters at the beginning of each word. If acronyms of 3 or more letters are included, only the first letter of the acronym is capitalized. For example, AverageAge, ContextBoundObject, RgbCode. Camel case: The same as pascal case, except the first letter is not capitalized. For example, averageAge, contextBoundObject, rgbCode.
