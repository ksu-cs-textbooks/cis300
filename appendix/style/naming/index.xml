Pascal case: Multiple words are joined without spaces, using capital letters at the beginning of each word. If acronyms of 3 or more letters are included, only the first letter of the acronym is capitalized. For example, AverageAge, ContextBoundObject, RgbCode. Camel case: The same as pascal case, except the first letter is not capitalized. For example, averageAge, contextBoundObject, rgbCode. Namespaces In CIS 300 programming assignments, namespace names will typically be provided. They will use the form Ksu.Cis300.ProgramName, where each of the 3 components is in pascal case. For example:</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/appendix/style/naming/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
