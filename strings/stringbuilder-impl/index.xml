There are several reasons for doing this. First, by examining these details, we can begin to understand why a StringBuilder is so much more efficient than a string when it comes to building long strings a character at a time. Second, by studying implementations of data structures, we can learn techniques that might be useful to us if we need to build our own data structures.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/strings/stringbuilder-impl/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
