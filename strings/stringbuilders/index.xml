This inefficiency is due to the fact that strings are immutable. In order to overcome the inefficiency of concatenation, we need an alternative data structure that we can modify. The StringBuilder class fills this need.
Like strings, StringBuilders implement sequences of characters, but the contents of StringBuilders can be changed. The StringBuilder class has six constructors. The simplest StringBuilder constructor takes no parameters and constructs an empty StringBuilder — i.e., a StringBuilder containing no characters:</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/strings/stringbuilders/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
