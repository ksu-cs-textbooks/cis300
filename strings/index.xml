Each of these data structures has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this chapter, we will examine how these two types are used and implemented. In the process, we will note the tradeoffs involved in using one or the other.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/strings/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><item><title>strings</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/strings/strings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/strings/strings/</guid><description>strings Instances of the string class are immutable sequences of characters. Because string is a class, it is a reference type. Because instances are immutable, once they are constructed, their contents cannot change. Note that this does not mean that string variables cannot change - we can assign a string variable s the value “abc” and later assign it the value “xyz”. These assignments simply assign to s references to different instances of the string class.</description></item><item><title>StringBuilders</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/strings/stringbuilders/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/strings/stringbuilders/</guid><description>StringBuilders In the previous section, we saw that building large strings from small pieces by concatenating them together is very inefficient. This inefficiency is due to the fact that strings are immutable. In order to overcome the inefficiency of concatenation, we need an alternative data structure that we can modify. The StringBuilder class fills this need.
Like strings, StringBuilders implement sequences of characters, but the contents of StringBuilders can be changed.</description></item><item><title>Implementation of StringBuilders</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/strings/stringbuilder-impl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/strings/stringbuilder-impl/</guid><description>Implementation of StringBuilders In this section, we will examine some of the implementation details of the StringBuilder class. There are several reasons for doing this. First, by examining these details, we can begin to understand why a StringBuilder is so much more efficient than a string when it comes to building long strings a character at a time. Second, by studying implementations of data structures, we can learn techniques that might be useful to us if we need to build our own data structures.</description></item></channel></rss>
