This review quiz will be due at the beginning of the lab time. For example, the materials and review quiz for Lab 2 will be made available at 4:30 pm on Mon., Aug. 19, and the review quiz will be due at 11:30 am on Wed., Aug. 21. The main purpose of these quizzes is to help prepare you for the in-class discussion and the lab assignment for the day on which the quiz is due. You will be allowed to take each quiz up to twice, and the higher grade will be recorded.</p><h3 id=lab-assignments>Lab Assignments</h3><p>One lab assignment will be assigned during each lab session. These assignments will each be due at the end of the lab time. Each lab assignment will be worth 2 points:</p><ul><li>1 point for making a legitimate attempt at completing the assignment.</li><li>1 point for fully implementing correct functionality.</li></ul><p><strong>You must do the lab assignment in the lab classroom during the lab period in which it is published in order to receive credit for it.</strong> The lowest five lab scores will not be counted toward your final grade - no other lab absences will be excused.</p><h3 id=homework-assignments>Homework Assignments</h3><p>Five programming assignments will be given as homework during the course of the semester. All solutions must be submitted electronically by the given due date. Late submissions will be accepted with a penalty of 1% per hour, or any portion of an hour, late; thus, if a submission is 1 minute late, the penalty is 1%. If multiple solutions are submitted for the same assignment, only the last one will be graded. No submissions will be accepted after three days (i.e., 72 hours) past the due date.</p><p>Each of the first four homework assignments will be worth 5% of the final grade. The fifth homework assignment will be a final project worth 10% of the final grade. The final project will take the place of a Final Exam.</p><h3 id=exams>Exams</h3><p>Exam dates can be found in Canvas. Each exam will be an hour exam beginning at 11:30am in place of a lab assignment for that day. They will each be worth one sixth (approx. 16.7%) of the final grade. Each exam will consist entirely of writing code. <strong>Except under extreme circumstances (as judged by me), no make-up exams will be given.</strong></p><h4 id=grading-scale>Grading Scale</h4><p>Final grades will be assigned according to the following scale:</p><ul><li>90%-100%: A</li><li>80%-89%: B</li><li>70%-79%: C</li><li>60%-69%: D</li><li>Below 60%: F</li></ul><h2 id=course-delivery>Course Delivery</h2><p>Details regarding the delivery of this course are given in the <a href=https://k-state.instructure.com/courses/162567/modules/681997 rel=external target=_blank>Course Introduction</a> module. In order to make sure you understand the delivery mechanisms, you must obtain a perfect score on the quiz in that module before you can begin the course material. You can take this quiz as many times as you need to get a perfect score. The score will <strong>not</strong> count toward your final grade.</p><h2 id=canvas>Canvas</h2><p>All assignments and other course materials will be distributed via <a href=http://canvas.ksu.edu rel=external target=_blank>Canvas </a>. Grade information may be accessed there, and announcements will be posted from time to time. Important class messages will be emailed to your KSU email addresses and posted as announcements. <strong>You must be enrolled in the course to access Canvas.</strong></p><h2 id=how-to-succeed-in-this-course>How to Succeed in This Course</h2><ul><li><strong>Prepare for labs</strong>. Preparatory videos, readings, slides, and a review quiz will be available for each lab assignment. Taking some time to familiarize yourself with the material prior to the lab time will help you to do well on the review quizzes and lab assignments, as well as to learn more from the lab experience.</li><li><strong>Take the review quizzes</strong>. These are due before the labs and will help to reinforce the preparatory materials. Taking the review quizzes will help you to learn the material and do well on the lab assignments and exams. Because you can take each quiz twice, if necessary, you should be able to earn all (or nearly all) of the points from these quizzes.</li><li><strong>Complete the lab assignments</strong>. We expect you to be able to complete these assignments correctly. Thus, you should be able to earn all (or nearly all) of the points from lab assignments for the semester. Furthermore, what you learn from this experience will help you to do well on the homework and the exams.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for help</strong>. While there is value in figuring things out on your own, sometimes a little help can go a long way. If you seem to be stuck on something (particularly on a lab assignment), or if something in the instructions doesn&rsquo;t make sense to you, ask for help from me or one of the lab assistants - that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re there for.</li><li><strong>Prepare for the exams</strong>. Following each lab, review the learning outcomes posted for that lab and make sure you understand what you should have learned. Also pay attention to the review quizzes. On the exams, you will be applying what you were expected to have learned in the labs.</li><li><strong>Start homework assignments early</strong>. Programming usually takes longer than you expect. Homework assignments will require much more time than lab assignments. Starting early will help you to complete the assignments on time.</li><li><strong>Review model solutions</strong>. Even if you completed the assignment, seeing how we did it can help you to learn more.</li></ul><h2 id=safe-zone-statement>Safe Zone Statement</h2><p>I am part of the SafeZone community network of trained K-State faculty/staff/students who are available to listen and support you.

Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor and Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/honor/ rel=external target=_blank>Honor and Integrity System</a> apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. A component vital to the Honor and Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: &ldquo;On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.&rdquo; A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.</p><p><strong>For this course, a violation of the Honor Pledge will result in sanctions such as a 0 on the assignment or an XF in the course, depending on severity. Actively seeking unauthorized aid, such as posting lab assignments on sites such as Chegg or StackOverflow, or asking another person to complete your work, even if unsuccessful, will result in an immediate XF in the course.</strong></p><p><strong>This course assumes that all your course work will be done by you. Use of AI text and code generators such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot in any submission for this course is strictly forbidden unless explicitly allowed by your instructor. Any unauthorized use of these tools without proper attribution is a violation of the <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/honor/basics/pledge.html rel=external target=_blank>K-State Honor Pledge</a>.</strong></p><p>We reserve the right to use various platforms that can perform automatic plagiarism detection by tracking changes made to files and comparing submitted projects against other students&rsquo; submissions and known solutions. That information may be used to determine if plagiarism has taken place.</p><h3 id=students-with-disabilities>Students with Disabilities</h3><p>At K-State it is important that every student has access to course content and the means to demonstrate course mastery.

K-State courses, labs, and other virtual and physical learning spaces promote equitable opportunity to learn, participate, contribute, and succeed, regardless of age, race, color, ethnicity, nationality, genetic information, ancestry, disability, socioeconomic status, military or veteran status, immigration status, Indigenous identity, gender identity, gender expression, sexuality, religion, culture, as well as other social identities.</p><p>Faculty and staff are committed to promoting equity and believe the success of an inclusive learning environment relies on the participation, support, and understanding of all students. Students are encouraged to share their views and lived experiences as they relate to the course or their course experience, while recognizing they are doing so in a learning environment in which all are expected to engage with respect to honor the rights, safety, and dignity of others in keeping with the <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/about/values/community/ rel=external target=_blank>K-State Principles of Community</a>.</p><p>If you feel uncomfortable because of comments or behavior encountered in this class, you may bring it to the attention of your instructor, advisors, and/or mentors.

It has been adapted from <a href=https://global.k-state.edu/students/courses/netiquette/ rel=external target=_blank>this statement</a> from K-State Global Campus, and the<a href=https://www.recurse.com/manual rel=external target=_blank>Recurse Center Manual</a>. We have adapted their ideas to fit this course.</p></div></div><p>Online communication is inherently different than in-person communication. When speaking in person, many times we can take advantage of the <em>context</em> and <em>body language</em> of the person speaking to better understand what the speaker <em>means</em>, not just what is said. This information is not present when communicating online, so we must be much more careful about what we say and how we say it in order to get our meaning across.</p><p>Here are a few general rules to help us all communicate online in this course, especially while using tools such as Canvas or Discord:</p><ul><li><strong>Use a clear and meaningful subject line to announce your topic.</strong> Subject lines such as &ldquo;Question&rdquo; or &ldquo;Problem&rdquo; are not helpful. Subjects such as &ldquo;Logic Question in Project 5, Part 1 in Java&rdquo; or &ldquo;Unexpected Exception when Opening Text File in Python&rdquo; give plenty of information about your topic.</li><li><strong>Use only one topic per message.</strong> If you have multiple topics, post multiple messages so each one can be discussed independently.</li><li><strong>Be thorough, concise, and to the point.</strong> Ideally, each message should be a page or less.</li><li><strong>Include exact error messages, code snippets, or screenshots, as well as any previous steps taken to fix the problem.</strong> It is much easier to solve a problem when the exact error message or screenshot is provided. If we know what you&rsquo;ve tried so far, we can get to the root cause of the issue more quickly.</li><li><strong>Consider carefully what you write before you post it.</strong> Once a message is posted, it becomes part of the permanent record of the course and can easily be found by others.</li><li><strong>If you are lost, don&rsquo;t know an answer, or don&rsquo;t understand something, speak up!</strong> Email and Canvas both allow you to send a message privately to the instructors, so other students won&rsquo;t see that you asked a question. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask questions anytime, as you can choose to do so without any fear of being identified by your fellow students.</li><li><strong>Class discussions are confidential.</strong> Do not share information from the course with anyone outside of the course without explicit permission.</li><li><strong>Do not quote entire message chains; only include the relevant parts.</strong> When replying to a previous message, only quote the relevant lines in your response.</li><li><strong>Do not use all caps.</strong> It makes it look like you are shouting. Use appropriate text markup (bold, italics, etc.) to highlight a point if needed.</li><li><strong>No feigning surprise.</strong> If someone asks a question, saying things like &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you don&rsquo;t know that!&rdquo; are not helpful, and only serve to make that person feel bad.</li><li><strong>No &ldquo;well-actually&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</strong> If someone makes a statement that is not entirely correct, resist the urge to offer a &ldquo;well, actually&mldr;&rdquo; correction, especially if it is not relevant to the discussion. If you can help solve their problem, feel free to provide correct information, but don&rsquo;t post a correction just for the sake of being correct.</li><li><strong>Do not correct someone&rsquo;s grammar or spelling.</strong> Again, it is not helpful, and only serves to make that person feel bad. If there is a genuine mistake that may affect the meaning of the post, please contact the person privately or let the instructors know privately so it can be resolved.</li><li><strong>Avoid subtle -isms and microaggressions.</strong> Avoid comments that could make others feel uncomfortable based on their personal identity. See the syllabus section on Diversity and Inclusion above for more information on this topic. If a comment makes you uncomfortable, please contact the instructor.</li><li><strong>Avoid sarcasm, flaming, advertisements, lingo, trolling, doxxing, and other bad online habits.</strong> They have no place in an academic environment.

Although new ideas or research results may be controversial or challenge established views, the health and growth of any society requires frank intellectual exchange. Academic freedom protects this type of free exchange and is thus essential to any university&rsquo;s mission.</p><p>Moreover, academic freedom supports collaborative work in the pursuit of truth and the dissemination of knowledge in an environment of inquiry, respectful debate, and professionalism. Academic freedom is not limited to the classroom or to scientific and scholarly research, but extends to the life of the university as well as to larger social and political questions. It is the right and responsibility of the university community to engage with such issues.</p><h3 id=campus-safety>Campus Safety</h3><p>Kansas State University is committed to providing a safe teaching and learning environment for student and faculty members.
