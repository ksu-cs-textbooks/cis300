For example, we may be trying to find the shortest path out of a maze. Each cell in the maze is a node, and an edge connects two nodes if we can move between them in a single step. In this problem, we simply want to minimize the number of edges in a path to an exit.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/graphs/breadth-first/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
