describing the use of a data type that implements a graph. We will then
examine how to use a graph to find shortest paths in a road map. We will
then examine the related problem of finding shortest paths through a

We will conclude by discussing how to implement a graph.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><section><h1 class=a11y-only>Subsections of Graphs</h1><article class=default><header class=headline></header><div hidden><h1 id=introduction-to-graphs>Introduction to Graphs</h1></div><h2 id=introduction-to-graphs>Introduction to Graphs</h2><p>There are two kinds of graphs: undirected and directed. An <em>undirected
graph</em> consists of:</p><ul><li>a finite set of <em>nodes</em>; and</li><li>a finite set of <em>edges</em>, which are 2-element subsets of the nodes.</li></ul><p>The fact that edges are 2-element sets means that the nodes that
comprise an edge must be distinct. Furthermore, within a set, there is
no notion of a &ldquo;first&rdquo; element or a &ldquo;second&rdquo; element &mdash; there are just
two elements. Thus, an edge expresses some symmetric relationship
between two nodes; i.e., if
<span class="math align-center">$ \{u, v\} $</span> is an edge then node
<span class="math align-center">$ u $</span> is
<em>adjacent</em> to node <span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ v $</span>,</span> and node
<span class="math align-center">$ v $</span> is adjacent to node <span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ u $</span>.</span> We also
might associate some data, such as a label or a length, with an edge.</p><p>We can think of an edge as &ldquo;connecting&rdquo; the two nodes that comprise it.
We can then draw an undirected graph using circles for the nodes and
lines connecting two distinct nodes for the edges. Following is an
example of an undirected graph with numeric values associated with the
edges:</p><p><a href=#R-image-e64cde7fe1f515045cf0056bbd558dfc class=lightbox-link><img alt="An undirected graph" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis300/graphs/intro/undirected-graph.jpg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

ordered pairs of distinct nodes rather than 2-element sets. Within an
ordered pair, there is a first element and a second element. We call the
first node of an edge its <em>source</em> and the second node its
<em>destination</em>. Thus, an edge in a directed graph expresses an asymmetric
relationship between two nodes; i.e., if
<span class="math align-center">$ (u, v) $</span> is an edge, then
<span class="math align-center">$ v $</span> is adjacent to <span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ u $</span>,</span> but
<span class="math align-center">$ u $</span> is not adjacent to
<span class="math align-center">$ v $</span> unless
<span class="math align-center">$ (v, u) $</span> is also an edge in the graph. As with undirected
graphs, we might associate data with an edge in a directed graph.</p><p>We can draw directed graphs like we draw undirected graphs, except that
we use an arrow to distinguish between the source and the destination of
an edge. Specifically, the arrows point from the source to the
destination. If we have edges
<span class="math align-center">$ (u, v) $</span> and <span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ (v, u) $</span>,</span> and if
these edges have the same data associated with them, we might simplify
the drawing by using a single line with arrows in both directions.
Following is an example of a directed graph with numeric values
associated with the edges:</p><p><a href=#R-image-d15b47ce44f77b50624448fb9da4b645 class=lightbox-link><img alt="A directed graph" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis300/graphs/intro/directed-graph.jpg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

edges cannot be removed, and values associated with edges cannot be
changed. However, it will be sufficient for our purposes. We will
examine its implementation details in <a href=/cis300/graphs/impl/>a later
section</a>. For now, we will
examine how it can be used.</p><p>Building a graph is straightforward using the constructor and the
<strong>AddNode</strong> and/or <strong>AddEdge</strong> methods. Note that because the
<strong>AddEdge</strong> method will automatically add given nodes that are not
already in the graph, the <strong>AddNode</strong> method is only needed when we need
to add a node that may have no incoming or outgoing edges.</p><p>For many graph algorithms, we need to process all of the edges in some
way. Often the order in which we process them is important, but not in
all cases. If we simply need to process all of the edges in some order
we can use <strong>foreach</strong> loops with the last two members listed above
to accomplish this:</p><ul><li>For each node in the graph:<ul><li>For each outgoing edge from that node:<ul><li>Process this edge.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><div hidden><h1 id=shortest-paths>Shortest Paths</h1></div><h2 id=shortest-paths>Shortest Paths</h2><p>In this section, we will consider a common graph problem &mdash; that of
finding a shortest path from a node <em>u</em> to a node <em>v</em> in a directed
graph. We will assume that each edge contains as its data a nonnegative
number. This number may represent a physical distance or some other
cost, but for simplicity, we will refer to this value as the <em>length</em> of
the edge. We can then define the length of a path to be the sum of the
lengths of all the edges along that path. A shortest path from <em>u</em> to
<em>v</em> is then a path from <em>u</em> to <em>v</em> with minimum length. Thus, for
example, the shortest path from <em>a</em> to <em>h</em> in the graph below is
<em>a</em>-<em>c</em>-<em>g</em>-<em>f</em>-<em>h</em>, and its length is
4.8 + 6.4 + 4.9 + 3.2 = 19.3.</p><p><a href=#R-image-62c4baabc7c4c06bbdf3998519327d20 class=lightbox-link><img alt="A directed graph" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis300/graphs/dijkstra/directed-graph.jpg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>
<a href=javascript:history.back(); class=lightbox-back id=R-image-62c4baabc7c4c06bbdf3998519327d20><img alt="A directed graph" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading=lazy src=/cis300/graphs/dijkstra/directed-graph.jpg></a></p><p>The biggest challenge in finding an algorithm for this problem is that
the number of paths in a graph can be huge, even for relatively small
graphs. For example, a directed graph with 15 nodes might contain almost
17 billion paths from a node <em>u</em> to a node <em>v</em>. Clearly, an algorithm
that simply checks all paths would be impractical for solving a problem
such as finding the shortest route between two given locations in North America.
In what follows, we will present a much more efficient algorithm due to
Edsger W. Dijkstra.</p><p>First, it helps to realize that when we are looking for a shortest path
from <em>u</em> to <em>v</em>, we are likely to find other shortest paths along the
way. Specifically, if node <em>w</em> is on the shortest path from <em>u</em> to <em>v</em>,
then taking that same path but stopping at <em>w</em> gives us a shortest path
from <em>u</em> to <em>w</em>. Returning to the above example, the shortest path from
<em>a</em> to <em>h</em> also gives us shortest paths from <em>a</em> to each of the nodes
<em>c</em>, <em>g</em>, and <em>f</em>. For this reason, we will generalize the problem to
that of finding the shortest paths from a given node <em>u</em> to each of the
nodes in the graph. This problem is known as the <em>single-source shortest
paths</em> problem. This problem is a bit easier to think about because we
can use shortest path information that we have already computed to find
additional shortest path information. Then once we have an algorithm for
this problem, we can easily modify it so that as soon as it finds the
shortest path to our actual goal node <em>v</em>, we terminate it.</p><p>Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm progresses by finding a shortest path to one node
at a time. Let <em>S</em> denote the set of nodes to which it has found a
shortest path. Initially, <em>S</em> will contain only <em>u</em>, as the shortest
path from <em>u</em> to <em>u</em> is the empty path. At each step, it finds a
shortest path that begins at <em>u</em> and ends at a node outside of <em>S</em>.
Let&rsquo;s call the last node in this path <em>x</em>. Certainly, if this path to
<em>x</em> is the shortest to <em>any</em> node outside of <em>S</em>, it is also the
shortest to <em>x</em>. The algorithm therefore adds <em>x</em> to <em>S</em>, and continues
to the next step.</p><p>What makes Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm efficient is the way in which it finds
each of the paths described above. Recall that each edge has a
nonnegative length. Hence, once a given path reaches some node outside
of <em>S</em>, we cannot make the path any shorter by extending it further. We
therefore only need to consider paths that remain in <em>S</em> until the last
edge, which goes from a node in <em>S</em> to a node outside of <em>S</em>. We will
refer to such edges as <em>eligible</em>. We are therefore looking for a
shortest path whose last edge is eligible.</p><p>Suppose (<em>w</em>, <em>x</em>) is an eligible edge; i.e., <em>w</em> is in <em>S</em>, but <em>x</em> is
not. Because <em>w</em> is in <em>S</em>, we know the length of the shortest path to
<em>w</em>. The length of a shortest path ending in (<em>w</em>, <em>x</em>) is simply the
length of the shortest path to <em>w</em>, plus the length of (<em>w</em>, <em>x</em>).</p><p>Let us therefore assign to each eligible edge (<em>w</em>, <em>x</em>) a priority
equal to the length of the shortest path to <em>w</em>, plus the length of
(<em>w</em>, <em>x</em>). A shortest path ending in an eligible edge therefore has a
length equal to the minimum priority of any eligible edge. Furthermore,
if the eligible edge with minimum priority is (<em>w</em>, <em>x</em>), then the
shortest path to <em>x</em> is the shortest path to <em>w</em>, followed by (<em>w</em>,
<em>x</em>).</p><p>We can efficiently find an eligible edge with minimum priority if we
store all eligible edges in a <strong>MinPriorityQueue&lt;TEdgeData,
Edge&lt;TNode, TEdgeData>></strong>. Note however, that when we include <em>x</em> in
<em>S</em> as a result of removing (<em>w, x</em>) from the queue, it will cause any
other eligible edges leading to <em>x</em> to become ineligible, as <em>x</em> will no
longer be outside of <em>S</em>. Because removing these edges from the
min-priority queue is difficult, we will simply leave them in the queue,
and discard them whenever they have minimum priority. This min-priority
queue will therefore contain all eligible edges, plus some edges whose
endpoints are both in <em>S</em>.</p><p>We also need a data structure to keep track of the shortest paths we
have found. A convenient way to do this is, for each node to which we
have found a shortest path, to keep track of this node&rsquo;s predecessor on
this path. This will allow us to retrieve a shortest path to a node <em>v</em>
by starting at <em>v</em> and tracing the path backwards using the predecessor
of each node until we reach <em>u</em>. A <strong>Dictionary&lt;TNode, TNode></strong> is
an ideal choice for this data structure. The keys in the dictionary will
be the nodes in <em>S</em>, and the value associated with a key will be that
key&rsquo;s predecessor on a shortest path. For node <em>u</em>, which is in <em>S</em> but
has no predecessor on its shortest path, we can associate a value of <em>u</em>
itself.</p><p>The algorithm begins by adding the key <em>u</em> with the value <em>u</em> to a new
dictionary. Because all of the outgoing edges from <em>u</em> are now eligible,
it then places each of these edges into the min-priority queue. Because
<em>u</em> is the source node of each of these edges, and the shortest path
from <em>u</em> to <em>u</em> has length 0, the priority of each of these edges will
simply be its length.</p><p>Once the above initialization is done, the algorithm enters a loop that
iterates as long as the min-priority queue is nonempty. An iteration
begins by obtaining the minimum priority <em>p</em> from the min-priority
queue, then removing an edge (<em>w</em>, <em>x</em>) with minimum priority. If <em>x</em>
is a key in the dictionary, we can ignore this edge and go on to the
next iteration. Otherwise, we add to the dictionary the key <em>x</em> with a
value of <em>w</em>. Because we now have a shortest path to <em>x</em>, there may be
more eligible edges that we need to add to the min-priority queue. These
edges will be edges from <em>x</em> that lead to nodes that are not keys in the
dictionary; however, because the min-priority queue can contain edges to
nodes that are already keys, we can simply add all outgoing edges from
<em>x</em>. Because the length of the shortest path to <em>x</em> is <em>p</em>, the priority
of each of these outgoing edges is <em>p</em> plus the length of the outgoing edge.</p><p>Note that an edge is added to the min-priority queue only when its
source is added as a key to the dictionary. Because we can only add a
key once, each edge is added to the min-priority queue at most once.
Because each iteration removes an edge from the min-priority queue, the
min-priority queue must eventually become empty, causing the loop to
terminate. When the min-priority queue becomes empty, there can be no
eligible edges; hence, when the loop terminates, the algorithm has found
a shortest path to every reachable node.</p><p>We can now modify the above algorithm so that it finds a shortest path
from <em>u</em> to a given node <em>v</em>. Each time we add a new key to the
dictionary, we check to see if this key is <em>v</em>; if so, we return the
dictionary immediately. We might also want to return this path&rsquo;s length,
which is the priority of the edge leading to <em>v</em>. In this case, we could
return the dictionary as an <strong>out</strong> parameter. Doing this would allow us
to return a special value (e.g., a negative number) if we get through
the loop without adding <em>v</em>, as this would indicate that <em>v</em> is
unreachable. This modified algorithm is therefore as follows:</p><ul><li>Construct a new dictionary and a new min-priority queue.</li><li>Add to the dictionary the key <em>u</em> with value <em>u</em>.</li><li>If <em>u</em> = <em>v</em>, return 0.</li><li>For each outgoing edge (<em>u</em>, <em>w</em>) from <em>u</em>:<ul><li>Add (<em>u</em>, <em>w</em>) to the min-priority queue with a priority of
the length of this edge.</li></ul></li><li>While the min-priority queue is nonempty:<ul><li>Get the minimum priority <em>p</em> from the min-priority queue.</li><li>Remove an edge (<em>w</em>, <em>x</em>) with minimum priority from the
min-priority queue.</li><li>If <em>x</em> is not a key in the dictionary:<ul><li>Add to the dictionary the key <em>x</em> with a value of <em>w</em>.</li><li>If <em>x</em> = <em>v</em>, return <em>p</em>.</li><li>For each outgoing edge (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) from <em>x</em>:<ul><li>Add (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) to the min-priority queue with
priority <em>p</em> plus the length of (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>).</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Return a negative value.</li></ul><p>The above algorithm computes all of the path information we need, but we
still need to extract from the dictionary the shortest path from <em>u</em> to
<em>v</em>. Because the value for each key is that key&rsquo;s predecessor, we can
walk backward through this path, starting with <em>v</em>. To get the path in
the proper order, we can push the nodes onto a stack; then we can remove
them in the proper order. Thus, we can extract the shortest path as
follows:</p><ul><li>Construct a new stack.</li><li>Set the current node to <em>v</em>.</li><li>While the current node is not <em>u</em>:<ul><li>Push the current node onto the stack.</li><li>Set the current node to its value in the dictionary.</li></ul></li><li>Process <em>u</em>.</li><li>While the stack is not empty:<ul><li>Pop the top node from the stack and process it.</li></ul></li></ul><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><div hidden><h1 id=unweighted-shortest-paths>Unweighted Shortest Paths</h1></div><h2 id=unweighted-shortest-paths>Unweighted Shortest Paths</h2><p>In some shortest path problems, all edges have the same length. For
example, we may be trying to find the shortest path out of a maze. Each
cell in the maze is a node, and an edge connects two nodes if we can
move between them in a single step. In this problem, we simply want to
minimize the number of edges in a path to an exit. We therefore say that
the edges are <em>unweighted</em> &mdash; they contain no explicit length
information, and the length of each edge is considered to be <span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span>.</span></p><p>We could of course apply <a href=/cis300/graphs/dijkstra/>Dijkstra&rsquo;s
algorithm</a> to this
problem, using
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span> as the length of each edge. However, if analyze what
this algorithm does in this case, we find that we can optimize it to
achieve significantly better performance.</p><p>The optimization revolves around the use of the min-priority queue. Note
that Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm first adds all outgoing edges from the start
node <em>u</em> to the min-priority queue, using their lengths as their
priorities. For unweighted edges, each of these priorities will be <span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span>.</span> As
the algorithm progresses it retrieves the minimum priority and removes
an edge having this priority. If it adds any new edges before removing
the next edge, they will all have a priority
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span> greater than the priority
of the edge just removed.</p><p>We claim that this behavior causes the priorities in the min-priority
queue to differ by no more than
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span>. To see this, we will show that we can
never reach a point where we change the maximum difference in priorities
from at most
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span> to more than <span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span>.</span> First observe that when the outgoing
edges from <em>u</em> are added, the priorities all differ by
<span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ 0 \leq 1 $</span>.</span> Removing an edge can&rsquo;t increase the
difference in the priorities stored. Suppose the edge we remove has
priority <span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ p $</span>.</span> Assuming we have not yet achieved a priority difference
greater than <span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span>,</span> any priorities remaining in the min-priority queue must
be either
<span class="math align-center">$ p $</span> or <span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ p + 1 $</span>.</span> Any edges we add before removing the
next edge have priority <span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ p + 1 $</span>.</span> Hence, the priority difference
remains no more than <span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span>.</span> Because we have covered all changes to the
priority queue, we can never cause the priority difference to exceed <span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span>.</span></p><p>Based on the above claim, we can now claim that whenever an edge is
added, its priority is the largest of any in the min-priority queue.
This is certainly true when we add the outgoing edges from <em>u</em>, as all
these edges have the same priority. Furthermore, whenever we remove an
edge with priority <span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ p $</span>,</span> any edges we subsequently add have priority
<span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ p + 1 $</span>,</span> which must be the maximum priority in the min-priority
queue.</p><p>As a result of this behavior, we can replace the min-priority queue with
an ordinary <a href=/cis300/stacks-queues/queues/>FIFO queue</a>, ignoring any priorities. For a graph with unweighted edges, the behavior of the algorithm will be the same.
Because accessing a FIFO queue is more efficient than accessing a
min-priority queue, the resulting algorithm, known as <em>breadth-first
search</em>, is also more efficient.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><div hidden><h1 id=implementing-a-graph>Implementing a Graph</h1></div><h2 id=implementing-a-graph>Implementing a Graph</h2><p>Traditionally, there are two main techniques for implementing a graph.
Each of these techniques has advantages and disadvantages, depending on
the characteristics of the graph. In this section, we describe the
implementation of the <strong>DirectedGraph&lt;TNode, TEdgeData></strong> class
from <a href=/cis300/graphs/impl/Ksu.Cis300.Graphs.dll><strong>Ksu.Cis300.Graphs.dll</strong></a>. This
implementation borrows from both traditional techniques to obtain an
implementation that provides good performance for any graph. In what
follows, we will first describe the two traditional techniques and
discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each. We will then outline the
implementation of <strong>DirectedGraph&lt;TNode, TEdgeData></strong>.</p><p>The first traditional technique is to use what we call an <em>adjacency
matrix</em>. This matrix is an
<span class="math align-center">$ n \times n $</span> boolean array, where
<span class="math align-center">$ n $</span> is the number
of nodes in the graph. In this implementation, each node is represented
by an <strong>int</strong> value <span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ i $</span>,</span> where <span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ 0 \leq i \lt n $</span>.</span> The
value at row
<span class="math align-center">$ i $</span> and column
<span class="math align-center">$ j $</span> will be <strong>true</strong> if there is an edge
from node
<span class="math align-center">$ i $</span> to node <span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ j $</span>.</span></p><p>The main advantage to this technique is that we can very quickly
determine whether an edge exists &mdash; we only need to look up one element
in an array. There are several disadvantages, however. First, we are
forced to use a specific range of <strong>int</strong> values as the nodes. If we
wish to have a generic node type, we need an additional data structure
(such as a <strong>Dictionary&lt;TNode, int></strong>) to map each node to its
<strong>int</strong> representation. It also fails to provide a way to associate a
value with an edge; hence, we would need an additional data structure
(such as a <strong>TEdgeData[int, int]</strong>) to store this information.</p><p>Perhaps the most serious shortcoming for the adjacency matrix, however,
is that if the graph contains a large number of nodes, but relatively
few edges, it wastes a huge amount of space. Suppose, for example, that
we have a graph representing street information, and suppose there are
about one million nodes in this graph. We might expect the graph to
contain around three million edges. However, an adjacency matrix would
require one trillion entries, almost all of which will be <strong>false</strong>.
Similarly, finding the edges from a given node would require examining
an entire row of a million elements to find the three or four outgoing
edges from that node.</p><p>The other traditional technique involves using what we call <em>adjacency
lists</em>. An adjacency list is simply a linked list containing
descriptions of the outgoing edges from a single node. These lists are
traditionally grouped together in an array of size <span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ n $</span>,</span> where
<span class="math align-center">$ n $</span> is
again the number of nodes in the graph. As with the adjacency matrix
technique, the nodes must be nonnegative <strong>int</strong>s less than <span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ n $</span>.</span> The
linked list at location
<span class="math align-center">$ i $</span> of the array then contains the descriptions
of the outgoing edges from node
<span class="math align-center">$ i $</span>.</p><p>One advantage to this technique is that the amount of space it uses is
proportional to the size of the graph (i.e., the number of nodes plus
the number of edges). Furthermore, obtaining the outgoing edges from a
given node simply requires traversing the linked list containing the
descriptions of these edges. Note also that we can store the data
associated with an edge within the linked list cell describing that
edge. However, this technique still requires some modification if we
wish to use a generic node type. A more serious weakness, though, is
that in order to determine if a given edge exists, we must search
through potentially all of the outgoing edges from a given node. If the
number of edges is large in comparison to the number of nodes, this
search can be expensive.</p><p>As we mentioned above, our implementation of
<strong>DirectedGraph&lt;TNode, TEdgeData></strong> borrows from both of these
traditional techniques. We start by modifying the adjacency lists
technique to use a <strong>Dictionary&lt;TNode, LinkedListCell&lt;TNode>?></strong>
instead of an array of linked lists. Thus, we can accommodate a generic
node type while maintaining efficient access to the adjacency lists.
While a dictionary lookup is not quite as efficient as an array lookup,
a dictionary would provide the most efficient way of mapping nodes of a
generic type to <strong>int</strong> array indices. Using a dictionary instead of an
array eliminates the need to do a subsequent array lookup. The linked
list associated with a given node in this dictionary will then contain
the destination node of each outgoing edge from the given node.</p><p>In addition to this dictionary, we use a
<strong>Dictionary&lt;(TNode, TNode), TEdgeData></strong> to facilitate
efficient edge lookups. The notation <strong>(T1, T2)</strong> defines a <em>tuple</em>, which is an ordered pair of elements, the first of type <strong>T1</strong>,
and the second of type <strong>T2</strong>. Elements of this type are described with
similar notation, <code>(x, y)</code>, where <code>x</code> is of type <strong>T1</strong> and <code>y</code> is of
type <strong>T2</strong>. These elements can be accessed using the <strong>public</strong>
properties <strong>Item1</strong> and <strong>Item2</strong>. In general, longer tuples can be
defined similarly.</p><p>This second dictionary essentially fills the role of an adjacency
matrix, while accommodating a generic node type and using space more
efficiently. Specifically, a tuple whose <strong>Item1</strong> is <code>u</code> and whose
<strong>Item2</strong> is <code>v</code> will be a key in this dictionary if there is an edge
from node <code>u</code> to node <code>v</code>. The value associated with this key will be
the data associated with this edge. Thus, looking up an edge consists of
a single dictionary lookup.</p><p>The two dictionaries described above are the only <strong>private</strong> fields our
implementation needs. We will refer to them as <code>_adjacencyLists</code> and
<code>_edges</code>, respectively. Because we can initialize both fields to new
dictionaries, there is no need to define a constructor. Furthermore,
given these two dictionaries, most of the <strong>public</strong> methods and
properties (see <a href=/cis300/graphs/intro/>&ldquo;Introduction to
Graphs&rdquo;</a>) can be
implemented using a single call to one of the members of one of these
dictionaries:</p><ul><li><strong>void AddNode(TNode node)</strong>: We can implement this method using the
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.dictionary-2.add?view=net-6.0#system-collections-generic-dictionary-2-add(-0-1)" rel=external target=_blank><strong>Add</strong></a>
method of <code>_adjacencyLists</code>. We associate an empty linked list with
this node.</li><li><strong>void AddEdge(TNode source, TNode dest, TEdgeData value)</strong>: See
below.</li><li><strong>bool TryGetEdge(TNode source, TNode dest, out TEdgeData? value)</strong>:
We can implement this method using the
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.dictionary-2.trygetvalue?view=net-6.0#system-collections-generic-dictionary-2-trygetvalue(-0-1@)" rel=external target=_blank><strong>TryGetValue</strong></a>
method of <code>_edges</code>.</li><li><strong>int NodeCount</strong>: Because <code>_adjacencyLists</code> contains all of the
nodes as keys, we can implement this property using this
dictionary&rsquo;s
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.dictionary-2.count?view=net-6.0#system-collections-generic-dictionary-2-count" rel=external target=_blank><strong>Count</strong></a>
property.</li><li><strong>int EdgeCount</strong>: We can implement this property using the
<strong>Count</strong> property of <code>_edges</code>.</li><li><strong>bool ContainsNode(TNode node)</strong>: We can implement this method
using the
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.dictionary-2.containskey?view=net-6.0#system-collections-generic-dictionary-2-containskey(-0)" rel=external target=_blank><strong>ContainsKey</strong></a>
method of <code>_adjacencyLists</code>.</li><li><strong>bool ContainsEdge(TNode source, TNode dest)</strong>: We can implement
this method using the <strong>ContainsKey</strong> method of <code>_edges</code>.</li><li><strong>IEnumerable&lt;TNode> Nodes</strong>: We can implement this property using
the
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.dictionary-2.keys?view=net-6.0#system-collections-generic-dictionary-2-keys" rel=external target=_blank><strong>Keys</strong></a>
property of <code>_adjacencyLists</code>.</li><li><strong>IEnumerable&lt;Edge&lt;TNode, TEdgeData>> OutgoingEdges(TNode
source)</strong>: See below.</li></ul><p>Let&rsquo;s now consider the implementation of the <strong>AddEdge</strong> method. Recall
from <a href=/cis300/graphs/intro/>&ldquo;Introduction to
Graphs&rdquo;</a> that this method
adds an edge from <code>source</code> to <code>dest</code> with data item <code>value</code>. If either
<code>source</code> or <code>dest</code> is not already in the graph, it will be added. If
either <code>source</code> or <code>dest</code> is <strong>null</strong>, it will throw an
<strong>ArgumentNullException</strong>. If <code>source</code> and <code>dest</code> are the same, or if
the edge already exists in the graph, it will throw an
<strong>ArgumentException</strong>.</p><p>In order to avoid changing the graph if the parameters are bad, we
should do the error checking first. However, there is no need to check
whether the edge already exists, provided we update <code>_edges</code> using its
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.dictionary-2.add?view=net-6.0#system-collections-generic-dictionary-2-add(-0-1)" rel=external target=_blank><strong>Add</strong></a>
method, and that we do this before making any other changes to the
graph. Because a dictionary&rsquo;s <strong>Add</strong> method will throw an
<strong>ArgumentException</strong> if the given key is already in the dictionary, it
takes care of this error checking for us. The key that we need to add
will be a <strong>(TNode, TNode)</strong> containing the two nodes, and the value
will be the <code>value</code>.</p><p>After we have updated <code>_edges</code>, we need to update <code>_adjacencyLists</code>. To
do this, we first need to obtain the linked list associated with the key
<code>source</code> in <code>_adjacencyLists</code>; however, because <code>source</code> may not exist
as a key in this dictionary, we should use the
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.dictionary-2.trygetvalue?view=net-6.0#system-collections-generic-dictionary-2-trygetvalue(-0-1@)" rel=external target=_blank><strong>TryGetValue</strong></a>
method to do this lookup (note that if <code>source</code> is not a key in this
dictionary, the <strong>out</strong> parameter will be set to <strong>null</strong>, which we can
interpret as an empty list). We then construct a new linked list cell
containing <code>dest</code> as its data and insert it at the beginning of
the linked list we retrieved. We then set this linked list as the new value
associated with <code>source</code> in <code>_adjacencyLists</code>. Finally, if
<code>_adjacencyLists</code> doesn&rsquo;t already contain <code>dest</code> as a key, we need to
add it with <strong>null</strong> as its associated value.</p><p>Finally, we need to implement the <strong>OutgoingEdges</strong> method. Because this
method returns an <strong>IEnumerable&lt;Edge&lt;TNode, TEdgeData>></strong>, it
needs to iterate through the cells of the linked list associated with
the given node in <code>_adjacencyLists</code>. For each of these cells, it will
need to <strong>yield return</strong> (see
&ldquo;<a href=/cis300/appendix/syntax/enumerators/>Enumerators</a>&rdquo;)
an <strong>Edge&lt;TNode, TEdgeData></strong> describing the edge represented by
that cell. The source node for this edge will be the node given to this
method. The destination node will be the node stored in the cell. The
edge data can be obtained from the dictionary <code>_edges</code>.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></section></div></main><div class=git-footer><p class=theme-version-footer>6.0.0</p><p>Last modified by:
