An <em>undirected
graph</em> consists of:</p><ul><li>a finite set of <em>nodes</em>; and</li><li>a finite set of <em>edges</em>, which are 2-element subsets of the nodes.</li></ul><p>The fact that edges are 2-element sets means that the nodes that
comprise an edge must be distinct. Furthermore, within a set, there is
no notion of a &ldquo;first&rdquo; element or a &ldquo;second&rdquo; element &mdash; there are just
two elements. Thus, an edge expresses some symmetric relationship
between two nodes; i.e., if <span class="math align-center">$ \{u, v\} $</span> is an edge then node <span class="math align-center">$ u $</span> is
<em>adjacent</em> to node <span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ v $</span>,</span> and node <span class="math align-center">$ v $</span> is adjacent to node <span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ u $</span>.</span> We also
might associate some data, such as a label or a length, with an edge.</p><p>We can think of an edge as &ldquo;connecting&rdquo; the two nodes that comprise it.
We can then draw an undirected graph using circles for the nodes and
lines connecting two distinct nodes for the edges. Following is an
example of an undirected graph with numeric values associated with the
edges:</p><p><a href=#R-image-5ea695887faff6a46dd04822cf9b078c class=lightbox-link><img alt="An undirected graph" class="border lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis300/graphs/intro/undirected-graph.jpg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>
<a href=javascript:history.back(); class=lightbox-back id=R-image-5ea695887faff6a46dd04822cf9b078c><img alt="An undirected graph" class="border lazy lightbox lightbox-image" loading=lazy src=/cis300/graphs/intro/undirected-graph.jpg></a></p><p>A <em>directed graph</em> is similar to an undirected graph, but the edges are
ordered pairs of distinct nodes rather than 2-element sets. Within an
ordered pair, there is a first element and a second element. We call the
first node of an edge its <em>source</em> and the second node its
<em>destination</em>. Thus, an edge in a directed graph expresses an asymmetric
relationship between two nodes; i.e., if <span class="math align-center">$ (u, v) $</span> is an edge, then
<span class="math align-center">$ v $</span> is adjacent to <span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ u $</span>,</span> but <span class="math align-center">$ u $</span> is not adjacent to <span class="math align-center">$ v $</span> unless
<span class="math align-center">$ (v, u) $</span> is also an edge in the graph. As with undirected
graphs, we might associate data with an edge in a directed graph.</p><p>We can draw directed graphs like we draw undirected graphs, except that
we use an arrow to distinguish between the source and the destination of
an edge. Specifically, the arrows point from the source to the
destination. If we have edges <span class="math align-center">$ (u, v) $</span> and <span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ (v, u) $</span>,</span> and if
these edges have the same data associated with them, we might simplify
the drawing by using a single line with arrows in both directions.
Following is an example of a directed graph with numeric values
associated with the edges:</p><p><a href=#R-image-851eb754bcef548997be6550a300ed9c class=lightbox-link><img alt="A directed graph" class="border lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis300/graphs/intro/directed-graph.jpg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

<strong>Ksu.Cis300.Graphs</strong> containing a class
<strong>DirectedGraph&lt;TNode, TEdgeData></strong> and a <strong>readonly</strong> structure

<strong>DirectedGraph&lt;TNode, TEdgeData></strong> implements a directed
graph whose nodes are of type <strong>TNode</strong>, which must be non-nullable. The edges each store a data item of type <strong>TEdgeData</strong>,
which may be any type. These edges can be represented using instances of
the <strong>Edge&lt;TNode, TEdgeData></strong> structure. We also can use the
<strong>DirectedGraph&lt;TNode, TEdgeData></strong> class to represent undirected
graphs &mdash; we simply make sure that whenever there is an edge
<span style=white-space:nowrap><span class="math align-center">$ (u, v) $</span>,</span> there is also an edge <span class="math align-center">$ (v, u) $</span> containing the

constructs an edge leading from <strong>source</strong> to <strong>dest</strong> and having
<strong>data</strong> as its data item.</li><li><strong>TNode Source</strong>: This property gets the source node for the edge.</li><li><strong>TNode Destination</strong>: This property gets the destination node for
the edge.</li><li><strong>TEdgeData Data</strong>: This property gets the data associated with the

<strong>ArgumentException</strong>. If <code>node</code> is <strong>null</strong>, it throws an
<strong>ArgumentNullException</strong>.</li><li><strong>void AddEdge(TNode source, TNode dest, TEdgeData value)</strong>: This
method adds a new edge from <code>source</code> to <code>dest</code>, with <code>value</code> as its
associated value. If either <code>source</code> or <code>dest</code> is not already in the
graph, it is automatically added. If <code>source</code> and <code>dest</code> are the
same node, or if there is already an edge from <code>source</code> to <code>dest</code>,
it throws an <strong>ArgumentException</strong>. If either <code>source</code> or <code>dest</code> is
<strong>null</strong>, it throws an <strong>ArgumentNullException</strong>.</li><li><strong>bool TryGetEdge(TNode source, TNode dest, out TEdgeData? value)</strong>:
This method tries to get the value associated with the edge from
<code>source</code> to <code>dest</code>. If this edge exists, it sets <code>value</code> to the
value associated with this edge and returns <strong>true</strong>; otherwise, it
sets <code>value</code> to the default value for the <strong>TEdge</strong> type and returns
<strong>false</strong>.</li><li><strong>int NodeCount</strong>: This property gets the number of nodes in the

whether the graph contains an edge from <code>source</code> to <code>dest</code>.</li><li><strong>IEnumerable&lt;TNode> Nodes</strong>: This property gets an enumerable
collection of the nodes in the graph.</li><li><strong>IEnumerable&lt;Edge&lt;TNode, TEdgeData>> OutgoingEdges(TNode

edges from the given node. If <code>source</code> is not a node in the graph,
it throws an <strong>ArgumentException</strong>. If <code>source</code> is <strong>null</strong>, it
throws an <strong>ArgumentNullException</strong>. Otherwise, each edge in the
collection returned is represented by an
<strong>Edge&lt;TNode, TEdgeData></strong></li></ul><p>This implementation is somewhat limited in its utility, as nodes or
edges cannot be removed, and values associated with edges cannot be
changed. However, it will be sufficient for our purposes. We will
examine its implementation details in <a href=/cis300/graphs/impl/>a later
section</a>. For now, we will
examine how it can be used.</p><p>Building a graph is straightforward using the constructor and the
<strong>AddNode</strong> and/or <strong>AddEdge</strong> methods. Note that because the
<strong>AddEdge</strong> method will automatically add given nodes that are not
already in the graph, the <strong>AddNode</strong> method is only needed when we need
to add a node that may have no incoming or outgoing edges.</p><p>For many graph algorithms, we need to process all of the edges in some
way. Often the order in which we process them is important, but not in
all cases. If we simply need to process all of the edges in some order
we can use <strong>foreach</strong> loops with the last two members listed above
to accomplish this:</p><ul><li>For each node in the graph:<ul><li>For each outgoing edge from that node:<ul><li>Process this edge.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div><script>window.MathJax=Object.assign(window.MathJax||{},{tex:{inlineMath:[["\\(","\\)"],["$","$"]],displayMath:[["\\[","\\]"],["$$","$$"]]},options:{enableMenu:!1}},JSON.parse("{}"))</script><script id=MathJax-script async src=/cis300/js/mathjax/tex-mml-chtml.js?1769099586></script><script src=/cis300/js/clipboard/clipboard.min.js?1769099586 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/perfect-scrollbar/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1769099586 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/theme.min.js?1769099586 defer></script><script src=/cis300/js/embed-iframe.min.js?1769099586 defer></script></body></html>
