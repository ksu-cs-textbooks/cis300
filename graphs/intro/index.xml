An undirected graph consists of:
a finite set of nodes; and a finite set of edges, which are 2-element subsets of the nodes. The fact that edges are 2-element sets means that the nodes that comprise an edge must be distinct. Furthermore, within a set, there is no notion of a “first” element or a “second” element — there are just two elements. Thus, an edge expresses some symmetric relationship between two nodes; i.e., if $ \{u, v\} $ is an edge then node $ u $ is adjacent to node $ v $, and node $ v $ is adjacent to node $ u $. We also might associate some data, such as a label or a length, with an edge.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/graphs/intro/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
