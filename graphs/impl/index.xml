Each of these techniques has advantages and disadvantages, depending on the characteristics of the graph. In this section, we describe the implementation of the DirectedGraph&lt;TNode, TEdgeData> class from Ksu.Cis300.Graphs.dll. This implementation borrows from both traditional techniques to obtain an implementation that provides good performance for any graph. In what follows, we will first describe the two traditional techniques and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each. We will then outline the implementation of DirectedGraph&lt;TNode, TEdgeData>.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/graphs/impl/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
