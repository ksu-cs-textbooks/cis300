We will assume that each edge contains as its data a nonnegative number. This number may represent a physical distance or some other cost, but for simplicity, we will refer to this value as the length of the edge. We can then define the length of a path to be the sum of the lengths of all the edges along that path.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/graphs/dijkstra/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
