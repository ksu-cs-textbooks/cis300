<h2 id="shortest-paths">Shortest Paths</h2>
<p>In this section, we will consider a common graph problem &mdash; that of
finding a shortest path from a node <em>u</em> to a node <em>v</em> in a directed
graph. We will assume that each edge contains as its data a nonnegative
number. This number may represent a physical distance or some other
cost, but for simplicity, we will refer to this value as the <em>length</em> of
the edge. We can then define the length of a path to be the sum of the
lengths of all the edges along that path. A shortest path from <em>u</em> to
<em>v</em> is then a path from <em>u</em> to <em>v</em> with minimum length. Thus, for
example, the shortest path from <em>a</em> to <em>h</em> in the graph below is
<em>a</em>-<em>c</em>-<em>g</em>-<em>f</em>-<em>h</em>, and its length is
4.8 + 6.4 + 4.9 + 3.2 = 19.3.</p>
<p><img src="directed-graph.jpg" alt="A directed graph"></p>
<p>The biggest challenge in finding an algorithm for this problem is that
the number of paths in a graph can be huge, even for relatively small
graphs. For example, a directed graph with 15 nodes might contain over
10 billion paths from a node <em>u</em> to a node <em>v</em>. Clearly, an algorithm
that simply checks all paths would be impractical for solving a problem
such as finding the shortest route between two given locations in North America.
In what follows, we will present a much more efficient algorithm due to
Edsger W. Dijkstra.</p>
<p>First, it helps to realize that when we are looking for a shortest path
from <em>u</em> to <em>v</em>, we are likely to find other shortest paths along the
way. Specifically, if node <em>w</em> is on the shortest path from <em>u</em> to <em>v</em>,
then taking that same path but stopping at <em>w</em> gives us a shortest path
from <em>u</em> to <em>w</em>. Returning to the above example, the shortest path from
<em>a</em> to <em>h</em> also gives us shortest paths from <em>a</em> to each of the nodes
<em>c</em>, <em>g</em>, and <em>f</em>. For this reason, we will generalize the problem to
that of finding the shortest paths from a given node <em>u</em> to each of the
nodes in the graph. This problem is known as the <em>single-source shortest
paths</em> problem. This problem is a bit easier to think about because we
can use shortest path information that we have already computed to find
additional shortest path information. Then once we have an algorithm for
this problem, we can easily modify it so that as soon as it finds the
shortest path to our actual goal node <em>v</em>, we terminate it.</p>
<p>Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm progresses by finding a shortest path to one node
at a time. Let <em>S</em> denote the set of nodes to which it has found a
shortest path. Initially, <em>S</em> will contain only <em>u</em>, as the shortest
path from <em>u</em> to <em>u</em> is the empty path. At each step, it finds a
shortest path that begins at <em>u</em> and ends at a node outside of <em>S</em>.
Let&rsquo;s call the last node in this path <em>x</em>. Certainly, if this path to
<em>x</em> is the shortest to <em>any</em> node outside of <em>S</em>, it is also the
shortest to <em>x</em>. The algorithm therefore adds <em>x</em> to <em>S</em>, and continues
to the next step.</p>
<p>What makes Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm efficient is the way in which it finds
each of the paths described above. Recall that each edge has a
nonnegative length. Hence, once a given path reaches some node outside
of <em>S</em>, we cannot make the path any shorter by extending it further. We
therefore only need to consider paths that remain in <em>S</em> until the last
edge, which goes from a node in <em>S</em> to a node outside of <em>S</em>. We will
refer to such edges as <em>eligible</em>. We are therefore looking for a
shortest path whose last edge is eligible.</p>
<p>Suppose (<em>w</em>, <em>x</em>) is an eligible edge; i.e., <em>w</em> is in <em>S</em>, but <em>x</em> is
not. Because <em>w</em> is in <em>S</em>, we know the length of the shortest path to
<em>w</em>. The length of a shortest path ending in (<em>w</em>, <em>x</em>) is simply the
length of the shortest path to <em>w</em>, plus the length of (<em>w</em>, <em>x</em>).</p>
<p>Let us therefore assign to each eligible edge (<em>w</em>, <em>x</em>) a priority
equal to the length of the shortest path to <em>w</em>, plus the length of
(<em>w</em>, <em>x</em>). A shortest path ending in an eligible edge therefore has a
length equal to the minimum priority of any eligible edge. Furthermore,
if the eligible edge with minimum priority is (<em>w</em>, <em>x</em>), then the
shortest path to <em>x</em> is the shortest path to <em>w</em>, followed by (<em>w</em>,
<em>x</em>).</p>
<p>We can efficiently find an eligible edge with minimum priority if we
store all eligible edges in a <strong>MinPriorityQueue&lt;TEdgeData,
Edge&lt;TNode, TEdgeData&gt;&gt;</strong>. Note however, that when we include <em>x</em> in
<em>S</em> as a result of removing (<em>w, x</em>) from the queue, it will cause any
other eligible edges leading to <em>x</em> to become ineligible, as <em>x</em> will no
longer be outside of <em>S</em>. Because removing these edges from the
min-priority queue is difficult, we will simply leave them in the queue,
and discard them whenever they have minimum priority. This min-priority
queue will therefore contain all eligible edges, plus some edges whose
endpoints are both in <em>S</em>.</p>
<p>We also need a data structure to keep track of the shortest paths we
have found. A convenient way to do this is, for each node to which we
have found a shortest path, to keep track of this node&rsquo;s predecessor on
this path. This will allow us to retrieve a shortest path to a node <em>v</em>
by starting at <em>v</em> and tracing the path backwards using the predecessor
of each node until we reach <em>u</em>. A <strong>Dictionary&lt;TNode, TNode&gt;</strong> is
an ideal choice for this data structure. The keys in the dictionary will
be the nodes in <em>S</em>, and the value associated with a key will be that
key&rsquo;s predecessor on a shortest path. For node <em>u</em>, which is in <em>S</em> but
has no predecessor on its shortest path, we can associate a value of <em>u</em>
itself.</p>
<p>The algorithm begins by adding the key <em>u</em> with the value <em>u</em> to a new
dictionary. Because all of the outgoing edges from <em>u</em> are now eligible,
it then places each of these edges into the min-priority queue. Because
<em>u</em> is the source node of each of these edges, and the shortest path
from <em>u</em> to <em>u</em> has length 0, the priority of each of these edges will
simply be its length.</p>
<p>Once the above initialization is done, the algorithm enters a loop that
iterates as long as the min-priority queue is nonempty. An iteration
begins by obtaining the minimum priority <em>p</em> from the min-priority
queue, then removing an edge (<em>w</em>, <em>x</em>) with minimum priority. If <em>x</em>
is a key in the dictionary, we can ignore this edge and go on to the
next iteration. Otherwise, we add to the dictionary the key <em>x</em> with a
value of <em>w</em>. Because we now have a shortest path to <em>x</em>, there may be
more eligible edges that we need to add to the min-priority queue. These
edges will be edges from <em>x</em> that lead to nodes that are not keys in the
dictionary; however, because the min-priority queue can contain edges to
nodes that are already keys, we can simply add all outgoing edges from
<em>x</em>. Because the length of the shortest path to <em>x</em> is <em>p</em>, the priority
of each of these outgoing edges is <em>p</em> plus the length of the outgoing edge.</p>
<p>Note that an edge is added to the min-priority queue only when its
source is added as a key to the dictionary. Because we can only add a
key once, each edge is added to the min-priority queue at most once.
Because each iteration removes an edge from the min-priority queue, the
min-priority queue must eventually become empty, causing the loop to
terminate. When the min-priority queue becomes empty, there can be no
eligible edges; hence, when the loop terminates, the algorithm has found
a shortest path to every reachable node.</p>
<p>We can now modify the above algorithm so that it finds a shortest path
from <em>u</em> to a given node <em>v</em>. Each time we add a new key to the
dictionary, we check to see if this key is <em>v</em>; if so, we return the
dictionary immediately. We might also want to return this path&rsquo;s length,
which is the priority of the edge leading to <em>v</em>. In this case, we could
return the dictionary as an <strong>out</strong> parameter. Doing this would allow us
to return a special value (e.g., a negative number) if we get through
the loop without adding <em>v</em>, as this would indicate that <em>v</em> is
unreachable. This modified algorithm is therefore as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Construct a new dictionary and a new min-priority queue.</li>
<li>Add to the dictionary the key <em>u</em> with value <em>u</em>.</li>
<li>If <em>u</em> = <em>v</em>, return 0.</li>
<li>For each outgoing edge (<em>u</em>, <em>w</em>) from <em>u</em>:
<ul>
<li>Add (<em>u</em>, <em>w</em>) to the min-priority queue with a priority of
the length of this edge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While the min-priority queue is nonempty:
<ul>
<li>Get the minimum priority <em>p</em> from the min-priority queue.</li>
<li>Remove an edge (<em>w</em>, <em>x</em>) with minimum priority from the
min-priority queue.</li>
<li>If <em>x</em> is not a key in the dictionary:
<ul>
<li>Add to the dictionary the key <em>x</em> with a value of <em>w</em>.</li>
<li>If <em>x</em> = <em>v</em>, return <em>p</em>.</li>
<li>For each outgoing edge (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) from <em>x</em>:
<ul>
<li>Add (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) to the min-priority queue with
priority <em>p</em> plus the length of (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Return a negative value.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above algorithm computes all of the path information we need, but we
still need to extract from the dictionary the shortest path from <em>u</em> to
<em>v</em>. Because the value for each key is that key&rsquo;s predecessor, we can
walk backward through this path, starting with <em>v</em>. To get the path in
the proper order, we can push the nodes onto a stack; then we can remove
them in the proper order. Thus, we can extract the shortest path as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Construct a new stack.</li>
<li>Set the current node to <em>v</em>.</li>
<li>While the current node is not <em>u</em>:
<ul>
<li>Push the current node onto the stack.</li>
<li>Set the current node to its value in the dictionary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Process <em>u</em>.</li>
<li>While the stack is not empty:
<ul>
<li>Pop the top node from the stack and process it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
