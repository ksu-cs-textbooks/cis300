In such data there is a primary key, a secondary key, and so on. We want to sort the data so that element a precedes element b if:
the primary key of a is less than the primary key of b; or their primary keys are equal, but the secondary key of a is less than the secondary key of b; etc. An example of multi-keyed data is strings. The first character of a string is its primary key, its second character is its secondary key, and so on. The only caveat is that the strings may not all have the same length; hence, they may not all have the same number of keys. We therefore stipulate that a string that does not have a particular key must precede all strings that have that key.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/sorting/strings/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
