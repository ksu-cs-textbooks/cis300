An unsorted part containing elements less than or equal to some pivot element p. A nonempty part containing elements equal to p. An unsorted part containing elements greater than or equal to p. This arrangement is illustrated in the following figure.
To complete the sort, it then sorts the two unsorted parts. Note that because the second part is nonempty, each of the two unsorted parts is smaller than the original data set; hence, the algorithm will always make progress.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/sorting/split/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
