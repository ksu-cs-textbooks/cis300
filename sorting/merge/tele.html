<h2 id="merge-sorts">Merge Sorts</h2>
<p>A merge sort works by merging together two sorted parts of an array.
Thus, we should focus our attention on an array that is partitioned into
two sorted parts, as shown in the following figure.</p>
<p>
<a href="#image-80369b2cb992e045924a2e31a1aaaad9" class="lightbox-link">

</a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox" id="image-80369b2cb992e045924a2e31a1aaaad9">
<img src="merge-sorts.jpg" alt="The arrangement at a step of a merge sort." class="lightbox-image" loading="lazy">
</a></p>
<p>The different ways of implementing a merge sort depend both on how the
above arrangement is achieved, and also on how the two parts are merged
together. The simplest implementation is an algorithm simply called
<em>merge sort</em>.</p>
<p>Merge sort uses recursion to arrange the array into two sorted parts. In
order to use recursion, we need to express our algorithm, not in terms
of sorting an array, but instead in terms of sorting a part of an array.
If the part we are sorting has more than one element, then we can split
it into two smaller parts of roughly equal size (if it doesn&rsquo;t have more
than one element, it is already sorted). Because both parts are smaller,
we can recursively sort them to achieve the arrangement shown above.</p>
<p>The more complicated step in merge sort is merging the two sorted parts
into one. While it is possible to do this without using another array
(or other data structure), doing so is quite complicated. Merge sort
takes a much simpler approach that uses a temporary array whose size is
the sum of the sizes of the two sorted parts combined. It first
accumulates the data items into the new array in sorted order, then
copies them back into the original array.</p>
<p>In order to understand how the merging works, let&rsquo;s consider a snapshot
of an arbitrary step of the algorithm. If we&rsquo;ve accumulated an initial
portion of the result, these elements will be the smallest ones. Because
both of the parts we are merging are sorted, these smallest elements
must come from initial portions of these two parts, as shown below.</p>
<p>
<a href="#image-c2a917bd316a60f1cbb40a18bd7d3c02" class="lightbox-link">

<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox" id="image-c2a917bd316a60f1cbb40a18bd7d3c02">
<img src="merging.jpg" alt="A snapshot of the merge." class="lightbox-image" loading="lazy">
</a></p>
<p>Initially, the three shaded areas above are all empty. In order to
proceed, we need local variables to keep track of the first index in
each of the three unshaded areas. We then iterate as long as <em>both</em> of
the unshaded areas are nonempty. On each iteration, we want to place the
next element into the temporary array. This element needs to be the
smallest of the unmerged elements. Because both parts of the given array
are sorted, the smallest unmerged element will be the first element from
one of the two unshaded parts of this array &mdash; whichever one is smaller
(for stability, we use the first if they are equal). We copy that
element to the beginning of the unshaded portion of the temporary array,
then update the local variables to reflect that we have another merged
item.</p>
<p>The above loop will terminate as soon as we have merged all the data
items from one of the two sorted parts; however, the other sorted part
will still contain unmerged items. To finish merging to the temporary
array, we just need to copy the remaining items to the temporary array.
We can do this by first copying all remaining items from the first
sorted part, then copying all remaining items from the second sorted
part (one of these two copies will copy nothing because there will be no
remaining items in one of the two sorted parts). Once all items have
been merged into the temporary array, we copy all items back to the
original array to complete the merge.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t do a running time analysis here, but merge sort runs in 
<span class="math align-center">$ O(n \lg n) $</span> time in the worst case. Furthermore, unlike <a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis300/sorting/select/#heap-sort">heap
sort</a>
, it is stable.
Because it tends to perform better in practice than <a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis300/sorting/insert/#tree-sort">tree
sort</a>
, it is a better
choice when we need a stable sorting algorithm. In fact, it is the basis
(along with <a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis300/sorting/insert">insertion
sort</a>
) of a stable
hybrid sorting algorithm that performs very well in practice. This
algorithm, called <em>Tim sort</em>, is rather complicated; hence, we won&rsquo;t
describe it here. If we don&rsquo;t need a stable sorting algorithm, though,
there are other alternatives, as we shall see in the next two sections.</p>
<p><span id="external"></span> Another scenario in which a merge sort is
appropriate occurs when we have a huge data set that will not fit into
an array. In order to sort such a data set, we need to keep most of the
data in files while keeping a relatively small amount within internal
data structures at any given time. Because merging processes data items
sequentially, it works well with files. There are several variations on
how we might do this, but the basic algorithm is called <em>external merge
sort</em>.</p>
<p>External merge sort uses four temporary files in addition to an input
file and an output file. Each of these files will alternate between
being used for input and being used for output. Furthermore, at any
given time, one of the two files being used for input will be designated
as the <em>first</em> input file, and the other will designated as the <em>second</em>
input file. Similarly, at any given time, one of the two files being
used for output will be designated as the <em>current</em> output file, and the
other will be designated as the <em>alternate</em> output file.</p>
<p>The algorithm begins with an initialization step that uses the given
unsorted data file as its input, and two of the temporary files as its
output. We will need two variables storing references to the current
output file and the alternate output file, respectively. At this point
we begin a loop that iterates until we reach the end of the input. Each
iteration of this loop does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fill a large array with data items from the input (if there aren&rsquo;t
enough items to fill this array, we just use part of it).</li>
<li>Sort this array using whatever sorting algorithm is appropriate.</li>
<li>Write each element of the sorted array to the current output file.</li>
<li>Write a special end marker to the output file.</li>
<li>Swap the contents of the variables referring to the current output
file and the alternate output file.</li>
</ol>
<p>After the above loop terminates, the two output files are closed. Thus,
the initialization writes several sorted sequences, each terminated by
end markers, to the two output files. Furthermore, either the two output
files will contain the same number of sorted sequences or the one that
was written to first will contain one more sorted sequence than the
other. The following figure illustrates these two files.</p>
<p>
<a href="#image-ee3d2d61d6db5fd5d5c5184a89955397" class="lightbox-link">
<img src="external-merge-sort.jpg" alt="Two files written by external merge sort" style="height: auto; width: auto;" loading="lazy">
</a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox" id="image-ee3d2d61d6db5fd5d5c5184a89955397">
<img src="external-merge-sort.jpg" alt="Two files written by external merge sort" class="lightbox-image" loading="lazy">
</a></p>
<p>The algorithm then enters the main loop. Initially the output file first
written in the initialization is designated as the first input file, and
the other file written in the initialization is designated as the second
input file. The other two temporary files are arbitrarily designated as
the current output file and the alternate output file. The loop then
iterates as long as the second input file is nonempty. Each iteration
does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>While there is data remaining in the second input file: <ol type="a">
<li />  Merge the next sorted sequence in the first input file with the
    next sorted sequence in the second input file, writing the
    result to the current output file (see below for details).
<li />  Write an end marker to the current output file.
<li />  Swap the current output file and the alternate output file.</ol>
</li>
<li>If there is data remaining in the first input file:<ol type="a">
<li />  Copy the remaining data from the first input file to the current
    output file
<li />  Write an end marker to the current output file.
<li />  Swap the current output file and the alternate output file.</ol>
</li>
<li>Close all four temporary files.</li>
<li>Swap the first input file with the alternate output file.</li>
<li>Swap the second input file with the current output file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each iteration therefore combines pairs of sorted sequences from the two
input files, thus reducing the number of sorted sequences by about half.
Because it alternates between the two output files, as was done in the
initialization, either the two output files will end up with the same
number of sequences, or the last one written (which will be the
alternate output file following step 2) will have one more than the
other. The last two steps therefore ensure that to begin the next
iteration, if the the number of sequences in the two input files is
different, the first input file has the extra sequence.</p>
<p>The loop described above finishes when the second input file is empty.
Because the first input file will have no more than one more sorted
sequence than the second input file, at the conclusion of the loop, it
will contain a single sorted sequence followed by an end marker. The
algorithm therefore concludes by copying the data from this file, minus
the end marker, to the output file.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s now consider more carefully the merge done in step 1a above. This
merge is done in essentially the same way that the merge is done in the
original merge sort; however, we don&rsquo;t need to read in the entire sorted
sequences to do it. Instead, all we need is the next item from each
sequence. At each step, we write the smaller of the two, then read the
next item from the appropriate input file. Because we only need these
two data items at any time, this merge can handle arbitrarily long
sequences.</p>
<p>For an external sorting algorithm, the most important measure of
performance is the number of file I/O operations it requires, as these
operations are often much more expensive than any other (depending, of
course, on the storage medium). Suppose the initial input file has 
<span class="math align-center">$ n $</span>
data items, and suppose the array we use in the initialization step can
hold 
<span class="math align-center">$ m $</span> data items. Then the number of sorted sequences written by the
initialization is  <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ n/m $</span>,</span> with any fractional part rounded up. Each
iteration of the main loop then reduces the number of sorted sequences
by half, with any fractional part again rounded up. The total number of
iterations of the main loop is therefore  <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ \lg (n/m) $</span>,</span> rounding
upward again. Each iteration of this loop makes one pass through the
entire data set. In addition, the initialization makes one pass, and the
final copying makes one pass. The total number of passes through the
data is therefore  <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ \lg (n/m) + 2 $</span>.</span> For example, if we are
sorting 
<span class="math align-center">$ 10 $</span> billion data items using an array of size 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span> million, we need

<span class="math align-center">$ \lg 10,000 + 2 $</span> passes, rounded up; i.e., we need 
<span class="math align-center">$ 16 $</span> passes
through the data.</p>
<p>Various improvements can be made to reduce the number of passes through
the data. For example, we can avoid the final file copy if we use
another mechanism for denoting the end of a sorted sequence. One
alternative is to keep track of the length of each sequence in each file
in a <strong>List&lt;long&gt;</strong>. If the temporary files are within the same
directory as the output file, we can finish the sort by simply renaming
the first input file, rather than copying it.</p>
<p>A more substantial improvement involves using more temporary files.
<em>
<span class="math align-center">$ k $</span>-way external merge sort</em> uses 
<span class="math align-center">$ k $</span> input and 
<span class="math align-center">$ k $</span> output files. Each
merge then merges 
<span class="math align-center">$ k $</span> sorted sequences into  <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span>.</span> This reduces the number
of iterations of the main loop to  <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ \log_k (n/m) $</span>.</span> Using
the fact that
<span style="white-space:nowrap">
<span class="math align-center">$ \log_{k^2} n = (\log_k n)/2 $</span>,</span>
we can conclude that squaring 
<span class="math align-center">$ k $</span> will reduce the number of passes
through the data by about half. Thus, 
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span>-way external merge sort will
make about half as many passes through the data as 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2 $</span>-way external merge
sort. The gain diminishes quickly after that, however, as we must
increase 
<span class="math align-center">$ k $</span> to 
<span class="math align-center">$ 16 $</span> to cut the number of passes in half again.</p>
