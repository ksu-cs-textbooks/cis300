Using arrays to implement data structures has performance advantages in
some cases, but this technique has its limitations. With this chapter,
we begin a study of data structures that use [reference
types](/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/reference-value) in a powerful
way. Rather than forming sequences by placing data items in adjacent
cells of an array, we instead use references to chain data elements
together in a sequence. For some applications, this ends up being more
efficient than using an array. As we will see in [a later
chapter](/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/trees), this chaining
technique can be further exploited to link data items in a hierarchical
way, providing even more flexible and efficient access.
