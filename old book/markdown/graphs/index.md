In this chapter, we examine a data structure known as a *graph*, which
can be used to represent a wide variety of data sets in which pairs of
data items are related in a certain way. Examples of such data sets
include road maps, data flows or control flows in programs, and
representations of communication networks. Because graphs are so widely
used, numerous algorithms on graphs have been devised. As a result, the
same algorithm can often be applied to a variety of applications because
the underlying data structure for each application is a graph.

We will begin by presenting the basic definitions and concepts, and
describing the use of a data type that implements a graph. We will then
examine how to use a graph to find shortest paths in a road map. We will
then examine the related problem of finding shortest paths through a
maze. We will conclude by discussing how to implement a graph.
