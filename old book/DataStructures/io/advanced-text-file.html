<h1>Advanced Text File I/O</h1>

Though the <b>File.ReadAllText</b> and <b>File.WriteAllText</b>
    methods provide simple mechanisms for reading and writing text
    files, they are not always the best choices.  For one reason,
    files can be very large - too large to fit into memory, or
    possibly even larger than the maximum length of a <b>string</b> in
    C# (2,147,483,647 characters).  Even when it is possible to store
    the entire contents of a file as a <b>string</b>, it may not be
    desirable, as the high memory usage may degrade the overall
    performance of the system.
<p>
For the purpose of handling a sequence of input or output data in more
      flexible ways, the .NET Framework provides <i>streams</i>.
      These streams are classes that provide uniform access to a wide
      variety of sequences of input or output data, such as files,
      network connections, other processes, or even blocks of memory.
      The <a
      href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.streamreader.aspx"><b>StreamReader</b></a>
      and <a
      href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.streamwriter.aspx"><b>StreamWriter</b></a>
      classes (in the <a
      href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.IO(v=vs.110).aspx"><b>System.IO</b></a>
      namespace) provide read and write, respectively, access to text
      streams, including text files.
</p>
Some of the more useful <b>public</b> members of the
    <b>StreamReader</b> class are:
<ul>
<li> A <a
	  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f2ke0fzy(v=vs.110).aspx">constructor</a>
	  that takes a <b>string</b> giving a file name as its only
	  parameter and constructs a <b>StreamReader</b> to read from
	  that file. </li>
<li> A <a
	  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ath1fht8(v=vs.110).aspx"><b>Read</b></a>
	  method that takes no parameters.  It reads the next
	  character from the stream and returns it as an <b>int</b>.  If
	  it cannot read a character because it is already at the end
	  of the stream, it returns -1 (it returns an
	  <b>int</b> because -1 is outside the range of <b>char</b>
	  values). </li>
<li> A <a
	  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.streamreader.readline(v=vs.110).aspx"><b>ReadLine</b></a>
	  method that takes no parameters.  It reads the next line
	  from the stream and returns it as a <b>string</b>.  If it
	  cannot read a line because it is already at the end of the
	  stream, it returns <b>null</b>. </li>
<li> An <a
	  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.streamreader.endofstream(v=vs.110).aspx"><b>EndOfStream</b></a>
	  property that gets a <b>bool</b> indicating whether the end
	  of the stream has been reached. </li>
</ul>
With these members, we can read a text file either a character at a
    time or a line at a time until we reach the end of the file.  The
    <b>StreamWriter</b> class has similar <b>public</b> members:
<ul>
<li> A <a
	  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fysy0a4b.aspx">constructor</a>
	  that takes a <b>string</b> giving a file name as its only
	  parameter and constructs a <b>StreamWriter</b> to write to
	  this file.  If the file already exists, it is replaced by
	  what is written by the <b>StreamWriter</b>; otherwise, a new
	  file is created. </li> <li> A <a
	  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/07ct6937.aspx"><b>Write</b></a>
	  method that takes a <b>char</b> as its only parameter.  It
	  writes this <b>char</b> to the end of the stream. </li>
<li> Another <a
	  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ce2kyyb4.aspx"><b>Write</b></a>
	  method that takes a <b>string</b> as its only parameter.  It
	  writes this <b>string</b> to the end of the stream. </li>
<li> A <a
	  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ebb1kw70.aspx"><b>WriteLine</b></a>
	  method that takes no parameters.  It writes a line
	  terminator to the end of the stream (i.e., it ends the
	  current line of text). </li>
<li> Another <a
	  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9d715e88.aspx"><b>WriteLine</b></a>
	  method that takes a <b>char</b> as its only parameter.  It
	  writes this <b>char</b> to the end of the stream, then
	  terminates the current line of text. </li>
<li> Yet another <a
	  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7ack4zyt.aspx"><b>WriteLine</b></a>
	  method that takes a <b>string</b> as its only parameter.  It
	  writes this <b>string</b> to the end of the stream, then
	  terminates the current line of text. </li>
</ul>
Thus, with a <b>StreamWriter</b>, we can build a text file a character
    at a time, a line at a time, or an arbitrary <b>string</b> at a
    time.  In fact, a number of other <b>Write</b> and
    <b>WriteLine</b> methods exist, providing the ability to write
    various other types, such as <b>int</b> or <b>double</b>.  In each
    case, the given value is first converted to a <b>string</b>, then
    written to the stream.
<a name="unmanaged-resources"></a>
<p>
Streams are different from other classes, such as <b>string</b>s or
      arrays, in that they are <i>unmanaged</i> resources.  When a
      managed resource, such as a <b>string</b> or an array, is no
      longer being used by the program, the garbage collector will
      reclaim the space that it occupies so that it can be allocated
      to new objects that may need to be constructed.  However, after
      a stream is constructed, it remains under the control of the
      program until the program explicitly releases it.  This has
      several practical ramifications.  For example, the underlying
      file remains <i>locked</i>, restricting how other programs may use
      it.  In fact, if an output stream is not properly <i>closed</i>
      by the program, some of the data written to it may not actually
      reach the underlying file.  This is because output streams are
      typically <i>buffered</i> for efficiency - when bytes are
      written to the stream, they are first accumulated in an internal
      array, then written as a single block when the array is full.
      When the program is finished writing, it needs to make sure that
      this array is <i>flushed</i> to the underlying file.
</p>
Both the <b>StreamReader</b> and <b>StreamWriter</b> classes have <a
      href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.idisposable.dispose(v=vs.110).aspx"><b>Dispose</b></a>
      methods to release them properly; however, because I/O typically
      requires exception handling, it can be tricky to ensure that
      this method is always called when the I/O is finished.
      Specifically, the <b>try-catch</b> may be located in a method
      that does not have access to the stream.  In such a case, the
      <b>catch</b>-block cannot call the stream's <b>Dispose</b>
      method.
<p>
<a name="using"></a>
To handle this difficulty, C# provides a <b>using</b> statement.  A
      <b>using</b> statement is different from a <b>using</b>
      directive, such as
<pre>
using System.IO;
</pre>
A <b>using</b> statement occurs within a method definition, not at the
    top of a code file.  Its recommended form is as follows:
<pre>
using ( /* declaration and initialization of disposable variable(s) */ )
{

    /* Code that uses the disposable variables(s) */

}
</pre>
Thus, if we want to read and process a text file whose name is given
    by the <b>string</b> variable <tt>fileName</tt>, we could use the
    following code structure:
<pre>
using (StreamReader input = new StreamReader(fileName))
{

    /* Code that reads and process the file accessed by the
     * StreamReader input */

}
</pre>
This declares the variable <tt>input</tt> to be of type
    <b>StreamReader</b> and initializes it to a new
    <b>StreamReader</b> to read the given file.  This variable is only
    visible with the braces; furthermore, it is read-only - its value
    cannot be changed to refer to a different <b>StreamReader</b>.
    The <b>using</b> statement then ensures that whenever control
    exits the code within the braces, <tt>input</tt>'s <b>Dispose</b>
    method is called.
<p>
More than one variable of the same type may be declared and
      initialized within the parentheses of a <b>using</b> statement;
      for example:
<pre>
using (StreamReader input1 = new StreamReader(fileName1),
    input2 = new StreamReader(fileName2))
{

    /* Code that reads from input1 and input2 */

}
</pre>
The type of variable(s) declared must be a subtype of <a
      href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.IDisposable(v=vs.110).aspx"><b>IDisposable</b></a>.
      This ensures that the variables each have a <b>Dispose</b>
      method.
<p>
As a complete example of the use of a <b>StreamReader</b> and a
      <b>StreamWriter</b>, together with a <b>using</b> statement for
      each, suppose we want to write a method that takes as its
      parameters two <b>string</b>s giving the name of an input file
      and the name of an output file.  The method is to reproduce the
      input file as the output file, but with each line prefixed by a
      line number and a tab.  We will start numbering lines with 1.
      The following method accomplishes this:
</p>
<pre>
/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Copies the file at inFileName to outFileName with each line prefixed by its line number
/// followed by a tab.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="inFileName"&gt;The path name of the input file.&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;param name="outFileName"&gt;The path name of the output file.&lt;/param&gt;
private void AddLineNumbers(string inFileName, string outFileName)
{
    using (StreamReader input = new StreamReader(inFileName))
    {
        using (StreamWriter output = new StreamWriter(outFileName))
        {
            int count = 0;
            while (!input.EndOfStream)
            {
                string line = input.ReadLine();
                count++;
                output.Write(count);
                output.Write('\t');   // The tab character
                output.WriteLine(line);
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>
We can call the above method within a <b>try</b>-block to handle any
    exceptions that may be thrown during the I/O.  The
    <b>catch</b>-block will not have access to either <tt>input</tt>
    or <tt>output</tt>, but it doesn't need it.  If an exception is
    thrown during the I/O, the two <b>using</b> statements will ensure
    that the <b>Dispose</b> methods of both the <b>StreamReader</b>
    and the <b>StreamWriter</b> are called.
