<h1>File Dialogs</h1>

The <a
      href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.aspx"><b>System.Windows.Forms</b></a>
      namespace contains two other classes that implement modal
      dialogs for obtaining file names from the user.  These classes
      are <a
      href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.openfiledialog(v=vs.110).aspx"><b>OpenFileDialog</b></a>,
      which is designed to obtain the name of a file to read, and <a
      href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.savefiledialog(v=vs.110).aspx"><b>SaveFileDialog</b></a>,
      which is designed to obtain the name of a file to write.
      Because we often need to obtain the name of a file prior to
      doing file I/O, it is appropriate to consider these classes now.
<p>
Although these dialogs are visually separate from the window from
      which they are opened, it is possible (and usually desirable) to
      add instances of these classes to a form from <a
      href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/design-window">the
      Design window</a>.  Both can be found in the "Dialogs" section
      of the Toolbox.  They can be added to the form simply by
      double-clicking on their names.  They will not appear on the
      form itself, but in a separate area of the Design window.  Their
      properties can then be modified in the same way as any other
      control.  We will discuss some of these properties a bit later
      in what follows.
</p>
Each of these classes has a method called <b>ShowDialog</b> that takes
    no parameters.  For example, if we call the <a
    href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e61ft40c(v=vs.110).aspx"><b>ShowDialog</b></a>
    method of an <b>OpenFileDialog</b>, a dialog resembling the
    following will be opened:
<p>
<img src="open-file-dialog.jpg" 
    alt="A picture of a file dialog should appear here.">
</p>
Similarly, calling the <b>ShowDialog</b>
    method of a <b>SaveFileDialog</b> opens a dialog resembling the
    following:
<p>
<img src="save-file-dialog.jpg"
    alt="A picture of a file dialog should appear here.">
</p>
Because these dialogs are modal, the method call will not return until the
    user closes the dialog.  It will then return a <a
    href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.dialogresult.aspx"><b>DialogResult</b></a>
    indicating how the user closed the form - either
    <b>DialogResult.OK</b> or <b>DialogResult.Cancel</b> (see <a
    href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/message-boxes">the
    previous section</a> for more
    information on the <b>DialogResult</b> type).  Therefore, if
    <tt>uxFileDialog</tt> is a variable referring to a file dialog, we
    typically use the following code template to display it:
<pre>
if (uxFileDialog.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)
{
                
    // Process the file

}
</pre>
Thus, if the user selects a file, we process it; otherwise, we do
    nothing.  In some cases, we might include an <b>else</b>
    containing code that needs to be executed if the user closes the
    dialog without selecting a file.
<p>
Processing a file will be discussed in the three sections that
      follow.  However, one thing we will certainly want to do prior
      to processing the file is to obtain the file name that the user
      selected (after all, this is the reason we display a file
      dialog).  We can obtain this file name via the dialog's <a
      href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.filedialog.filename(v=vs.110).aspx"><b>FileName</b></a>
      <a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/properties">property</a>;
      for example,
</p>
<pre>
string fileName = uxFileDialog.FileName;
</pre>
Note that this and other properties are accessible for initialization
    purposes through a file dialog's Properties window in the
    Designer.  This is useful for an <b>OpenFileDialog</b>'s
    <b>FileName</b> property, as the default supplied by Visual
    Studio® is rather odd.  Other properties that we might want to
    initialize here (in addition to <b>(Name)</b>, the name of the
    variable referring to the dialog) include:
<ul>
<li> <a
	  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.filedialog.title(v=vs.110).aspx"><b>Title</b></a>,
	  the title of the dialog (by default, "Open" for an
	  <b>OpenFileDialog</b> or "Save As" for a
	  <b>SaveFileDialog</b>). </li>
<li> <a
	  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.filedialog.filter(v=vs.110).aspx"><b>Filter</b></a>,
	  a <i>filter string</i>, which controls what file types will
	  be displayed.  An example of a filter string is:
<pre>
C# files|*.cs|All files|*.*
</pre>
A filter string consists of an even number of components separated by
	vertical bars ("|").  Thus, the above filter string consists
	of four components.  These components are grouped into pairs.
	The first component of each pair gives the string that will be
	displayed in the dialog to describe what files are displayed.
	The second component of each pair describes a pattern of file
	names to be displayed when the first component of that pair is
	shown.  Use an asterisk ("*") in a pattern to denote any
	sequence of characters.  The "." in a pattern ending in ".*"
	does not need to be matched - a file without an extension will
	be listed if it matches the pattern to the left of the ".".
	Multiple patterns, separated by semicolons (";"), may be
	listed in one component.  Thus, the above filter string
	describes two filters that the user may choose from.  The
	first filter is labeled, "C# files", and lists all files
	ending in ".cs".  The second filter is labeled "All files",
	and lists all files. </li>
<li> <a
	href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.filedialog.filterindex(v=vs.110).aspx"><b>FilterIndex</b></a>
	indicates which pair in the filter string is currently being
	used.  Note that the first pair has an index of 1, not
	0. </li>
<li> <a
	href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.filedialog.addextension(v=vs.110).aspx"><b>AddExtension</b></a>
	and <a
	  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.filedialog.defaultext(v=vs.110).aspx"><b>DefaultExt</b></a>
	control the dialog's behavior when the user types in a file
	name without an extension.  When this happens, if a filter
	with a unique extension is chosen, that extension will be
	appended, regardless of the values of these two properties.
	Otherwise, if <b>AddExtension</b> is <b>True</b>, the value of
	<b>DefaultExt</b> will be appended, following a ".".</li>
</ul>
Other properties allow further customization of file dialogs.  For
    more details, see the <a
