Input and output are central concepts to computing - in order to be
      able to accomplish a computational task, a program must
      typically process some input and produce some output.  Input and
      output may be presented in a variety of ways.  For example,
      many programs communicate with users through a graphical
      user interface, or GUI.  In the simplest case, the user performs
      some action, such as clicking the mouse on a button, thus
      signaling an <i>event</i>.  A method in the program then
      responds to that event by reading information that the user has
      typed into various cotrols on the GUI, and processes that
      information.  It may then provide output to the user by writing
      results to various controls on the GUI.
</p>
<p>
Such a simple presentation of input/output (or I/O) is far too
    limiting, however.  For example, other mechansims such as
    <i>dialogs</i> - secondary windows designed for exchanging specific
    information - may be used to avoid cluttering the main window.  In
    other cases, the amount of data that needs to be exchanged is too
    large to be transferred through a GUI.  In such cases, the program
    may need to read and/or write a file.  This chapter addresses
    these more advanced I/O mechanisms.
