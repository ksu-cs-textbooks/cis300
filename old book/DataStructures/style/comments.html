<h1>Comments</h1>

Within each source file that you edit, you will need to provide
    certain comments as documentation.  Visual Studio® automatically
    generates source files that you will not need to modify - you
    don't need to add comments to those files.
<p></p>
At the top of each file, add a comment of the following form:
<pre>
/* filename.cs
 * Author: Name 
 */
</pre>
where <tt>filename.cs</tt> is the name of the file, and <tt>Name</tt>
    is the name of the primary author.  The primary author will
    either be you or, for files provided for you, the name of the
    original author of that file. Whenever
    you use someone else's 
    code, it is important that you give them credit for it.  (To fail
    to do this is plagiarism.)  Thus, if one of your source files was
    originally written by Rod Howell, leave his name as the
    author. If you have modified the original file, below the
    <tt>Author</tt> line, insert a line of the 
    following form:
<pre>
 * Modified by: Your Name
</pre>
Other comments documenting the use of provided code are
    described below.
<p></p>
Prior to each class, <a
    href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/structs">structure</a>, <a
    href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/enumerations">enumeration</a>,
    field, <a
    href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/properties">property</a>,
    and  
    method, place a comment documenting its use.  This comment should
    be delimited by "///" on each line.  When you type "///"
    immediately above a class, structure, enumeration, field,
    property, or method, the IDE will automatically insert additional
    text to form a comment stub such as:
<p></p>
<pre>
/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// 
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
</pre>
<p></p>
"<tt>&lt;summary&gt;</tt>" and "<tt>&lt;/summary&gt;</tt>" are <i>XML
      tags</i>, which are 
    understood by the IDE.  Between these tags, you should insert a
    summary of the program component you are documenting.  For
    example:
<p></p>
<pre>
/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Indicates whether this structure is empty.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
private bool _isEmpty;
</pre>
<p></p>
If the program component being documented is a method with at least
    one parameter and/or a non-<b>void</b> return type, additional XML
    tags will be generated by the IDE.  For each parameter, "param"
    and "/param" tags will be generated.  You should insert a
    description of the use of that parameter between these tags.  If
    the method has a non-<b>void</b> return type, "return" and
    "/return" tags are generated.  You should insert an explanation of
    the value being returned between these tags.  For example:
<p></p>
<pre>
/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Computes the number of times a given string x
/// occurs within a given string y.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="x"&gt;The string being searched for.&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;param name="y"&gt;The string being searched.&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;The number of occurrences of x in y.&lt;/returns&gt;
private int Occurrences(string x, string y)
{
    . . .
}
</pre>
<p></p>
In your method summaries, include  any requirements that must be satisfied by
    the calling code in order for it to work properly. Comments should
    also be used within methods to explain anything that is not
    obvious from the code itself. For event handlers automatically
    inserted by the IDE, a simple description of the purpose of the
    event handler is sufficient for the summary - you don't need to
    describe the parameters.
<p></p>
If you are starting from a file provided for you, wherever you have
    modified this code, add a comment 
    indicating what you have modified.  If you are inserting provided
    code into a file that is  
	predominantly your own creation, include comments that make it
	clear what code was provided, and who wrote it.
	If you modify it, include comments indicating where you have
	modified it.
