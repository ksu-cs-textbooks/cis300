<h1>General Formatting</h1>
<p>
All programming will be done using Microsoft <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs">Visual Studio® 2015</a>.  This
    integrated development environment (IDE) does
    a certain amount of formatting automatically.  All code formatting
    should be consistent with what the IDE does automatically,
    including how it formats code stubs that it inserts.
    Specifically, all braces should occur on lines by themselves,
    vertically aligned so that matching braces occupy the same
    column.  (An exception to this rule can be made when the braces
    enclose a single statement or a part of a statement, and they
    occur on the same line; however, if it is possible to omit
    the braces, as in an <b>if</b> statement, this is preferable to
    placing them on the same line.)  Furthermore, blocks of code
    enclosed by braces should be indented one tab stop inside the
    braces.  An easy way to format a file consistently (after removing
    any syntax errors) is to select
    from the "Edit" menu, "Advanced Ã¢â‚¬â€˜&gt; Format Document".
</p>
<p>
Don't change the formatting defaults in the IDE.
