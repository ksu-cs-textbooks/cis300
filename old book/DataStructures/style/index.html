Software companies typically have programming style requirements to
    which their programmers must adhere.  Many of these requirements
    have become industry standards.  These requirements help to make
    the developed code more readable, portable, and maintainable.
    This appendix contains a short set (much shorter than what is typically
    found in industry) of programming style requirements for CIS 300.
    Most of these requirements are derived from a <a href="http://10rem.net/articles/net-naming-conventions-and-programming-standards---best-practices">style guide posted at Pete Brown's 10rem.net</a>; that guide is consistent with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229002.aspx">Microsoft's Naming Guidelines</a> and de facto industry accepted practices.
Other requirements are simplifications introduced due to the fact that
    this programming is for course assignments, rather than for
    distribution.
