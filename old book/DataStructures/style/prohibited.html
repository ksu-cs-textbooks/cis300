<h1>Prohibited Features</h1>

The following features of C# should not be used on assignments or exams:

<ul>
<li> <b>The goto statement:</b> It has been over 45 years since
	Dijkstra published <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD215.PDF">"Go To Statement Considered Harmful"</a> (<i>Communications of the ACM</i>, vol. 11 (1968), pp. 147-148).  
I am amazed that languages continue to include this statement. </li>
<li> <b>The unsafe keyword:</b> The name pretty much says it
	all. </li>
<li> <b>The var keyword:</b> There are very few contexts in which this
	is needed, and these contexts won't occur in this class.  For
	all other contexts, it makes the code less readable. 

<li> <b>Virtual methods:</b>  These are useful in large-scale software
	development; however, they are overused. They will not be
	needed in the programming we will be doing.  (However, virtual
	methods in the .NET class library may be <a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/method-overriding">overridden</a>.)
	</li>
<li> <b>Extension methods:</b>  These methods are not defined within
	the class on which they operate, but elsewhere.  Consequently,
	they tend to be much less efficient than the methods defined
	within the class.  If the Visual StudioÂ® auto-complete gives
	you a method that looks like it 
	gives you what you want, first click on it and take a look at
	its popup documentation.  If it is an extension method,
	this documentation will begin with "(extension)". </li>
</li></ul>
