We conclude this text with a look at a common activity in computing,
    namely, sorting data.  While the .NET Framework provides several
    methods for sorting data, it is instructive to examine the
    implementation details of different techniques.  While there is
    one sorting algorithm that is used more commonly than the others,
    none is best for all situations.  An understanding of which
    algorithms perform better in different situations can help us to
    make better choices and thereby achieve better performance for the
    software we build.  Furthermore, because there are so many
    different approaches to sorting, studying the various techniques
    can help us to see how different approaches can be used for the
    same problem in order to obtain different algorithms.
<p>
In this chapter, we will consider several sorting algorithms, but not
      nearly all of them.  In the first five sections, we will focus
      on algorithms that can be applied to any data type that can
      sorted; thus, we will only consider algorithms that operate by
      comparing data elements to each other.  Most of these algorithms
      can be divided into four general approaches.  We consider each
      of these approaches separately, then show how some of these
      approaches can be combined to obtain better performance than we
      can achieve with any one of them.  We then conclude with an
      algorithm designed specifically for sorting strings.
