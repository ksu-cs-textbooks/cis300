<h1>Sorting Strings</h1>

We conclude our discussion of sorting with a look at a sorting
    algorithm designed specifically for sorting multi-keyed data.  In
    such data there is a primary key, a secondary key, and so on.  We
    want to sort the data so that element <i>a</i> precedes element
    <i>b</i> if:
<ul>
<li> the primary key of <i>a</i> is less than the primary key of
	<i>b</i>; </li>
<li> or their primary keys are equal, but the secondary key of
	<i>a</i> is less than the secondary key of <i>b</i>;</li>
<li> etc.</li>
</ul>
An example of multi-keyed data is strings.  The first character of a
    string is its primary key, its second character is its secondary
    key, and so on.  The only caveat is that the strings may not all
    have the same length; hence, they may not all have the same number
    of keys.  We therefore stipulate that a string that does not have
    a particular key must precede all strings that have that key.
<p>
One algorithm to sort multi-keyed data is known as <i>multi-key quick
	sort</i>.  In this section, we will describe multi-key quick
	sort as it applies specifically to sorting strings; however,
	it can be applied to other multi-keyed data as well.
</p>
One problem with sorting strings using a version of quick sort
    described in "<a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/split-sorts">Split
    Sorts</a>" is that string comparisons can be expensive.
    Specifically, they must compare the strings a character at a time
    until they reach either a mismatch or the end of a string.  Thus,
    comparing strings that have a long prefix in common is expensive.
    Now observe that quick sort operates by splitting the array into
    smaller and smaller pieces whose elements belong near each other
    in the sorted result.  It is therefore common to have some pieces
    whose elements all begin with the same long prefix.
<p>
Multi-key quick sort improves the performance by trying to avoid
      comparing prefixes after they have already been found to be the
      same (though the suffixes may differ).  In order to accomplish
      this, it uses an extra <b>int</b> parameter
      <tt>k</tt> such that all the strings being sorted match in their
      first <tt>k</tt> positions (and by implication, all strings have
      length at least <tt>k</tt>).  We can safely use a value of 0 in
      the initial call, but this value can increase as recursive calls
      are made.
</p>
Because all strings begin with the same prefix of length <tt>k</tt>,
    we can focus on the character at location <tt>k</tt> (i.e.,
    following the first <tt>k</tt> characters) of each string.  We
    need to be careful, however, because some of the strings may not
    have a character at location <tt>k</tt>.  We will therefore use an
    <b>int</b> to store the value of the character at location
    <tt>k</tt> of a string, letting -1 denote the absence of a
    character at that location.
<p>
The algorithm then proceeds a lot like those described in "<a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/split-sorts">Split
	Sorts</a>".  If the number of elements being sorted is greater
	than 1, a pivot element <tt>p</tt> is found.  Note that
	<tt>p</tt> is not a <b>string</b>, but an <b>int</b>
	representing a character at location <tt>k</tt>, as described
	above.  The elements are then partitioned into groups of
	strings whose character at location <tt>k</tt> is less than
	<tt>p</tt>, equal to <tt>p</tt>, or greater than <tt>p</tt>,
	respectively.
</p>
After these three groups are formed, the first and third group are
    sorted recursively using the same value for <tt>k</tt>.
    Furthermore, the second group may not be completely sorted yet -
    all we know is that all strings in this group agree on the first
    <tt>k</tt> + 1 characters.  Thus, unless <tt>p</tt> is
    -1 (indicating that that these strings all have length <tt>k</tt>,
    and are therefore all equal), we need to recursively sort this
    group as well.  However, because we know that the strings in this
    group all agree on the first <tt>k</tt> + 1 characters,
    we pass <tt>k</tt> + 1 as the last parameter.
<p>
One aspect of this algorithm that we need to address is whether the
      recursion is valid.  Recall that <a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/recursion">when we
      introduced recursion</a>, we stated that in order to guarantee
      termination, all recursive calls must be on smaller problem
      instances, where the size of a problem instance is given by a
      nonnegative integer.  In the algorithm described above, we might
      reach a point at which all of the strings being sorted match in
      location <tt>k</tt>.  In such a case, the second recursive call
      will contain all of the strings.
</p>
By being careful how we define the size of the problem instance,
    however, we can show that this recursion is, in fact, valid.
    Specifically, we define the size of the problem instance to be the
    number of strings being sorted, plus the
    total number of characters beginning at location <tt>k</tt> in
    all strings being sorted.  Because there is at least one string
    containing <tt>p</tt> at location <tt>k</tt>, the number of
    strings in both the first and the third recursive call must be
    smaller, while the total number of characters beginning at
    location <tt>k</tt> can be no larger.  Because <tt>k</tt>
    increases by 1 in the second recursive call, the total number of
    characters past this location must be smaller, while the number of
    strings can be no larger.  Hence, the size decreases in all
    recursive calls.
<p>
The fact that we are doing recursion on the length of strings,
      however, can potentially cause the runtime stack to overflow
      when we are sorting very long strings.  For this reason, it is
      best to convert the recursive call on the second group to a
      loop.  We can do this by changing the <b>if</b>-statement that
      controls whether the splitting will be done into a
      <b>while</b>-loop that iterates as long as the portion being
      sorted is large enough to split.  Then at the bottom of the
      loop, after doing recursive calls on the first and third parts,
      we check to see if <tt>p</tt> is -1 - if so, we terminate the
      loop.  Otherwise,
      we do the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>increment <tt>k</tt>; </li>
<li>change the index giving the start of the portion we are sorting to the
	beginning of the second part; and </li>
<li>change the length of the portion we are sorting to the length of
	the second part.
</li></ul>
The next iteration will then sort the second part.
<p>
This algorithm can be combined with <a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/insert-sorts">insertion
	sort</a> and <a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/heap-sort">heap
	sort</a>, as was done for introsort in <a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/hybrid-sorts">the
	previous section</a>.  However, we should also modify
	insertion sort and heap sort to use the information we already
	have about equal prefixes when we are comparing elements.
	Specifically, rather than comparing entire strings, we should
	begin comparing after the equal prefix.  Because of the way
	multi-key quick sort does comparisons, the result tends to
	perform better than the single-key versions, assuming similar
	optimizations are made; however, cutoffs for running insertion
	sort and/or heap sort may need to be adjusted.
