<h1>The Dictionary&lt;TKey,Ã‚Â TValue&gt; Class</h1>

    A common problem in computing is that of keyed storage and
    retrieval.  Specifically, we have a number of data items, each
    having a unique <i>key</i>.  This key may be any type, and is used
    to find the associated data item; i.e., given a key we need to
    find the data item associated with that key.  A data structure
    that provides this kind of access is called a <i>dictionary</i>.
    The .NET Framework provides the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xfhwa508.aspx"><b>Dictionary&lt;TKey,Ã‚Â TValue&gt;</b></a>
    class for this purpose.  In this section, we will discuss the use
    of this class.  In <a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/dictionary-linked-lists">the
    next section</a>, we will discuss how this data structure can be
    implemented using a linked list.  In subsequent sections, we will
    consider alternative implementations.
<p>
Note that the <b>Dictionary&lt;TKey,Ã‚Â TValue&gt;</b> has two type
      parameters, <b>TKey</b> and <b>TValue</b>.  <b>TKey</b> is the
      type of the keys, and <b>TValue</b> is the type of the values
      (i.e., the data elements associated the keys).  Keys
      must always be non-<b>null</b> - any attempt to use a
      <b>null</b> key will result in an <b>ArgumentNullException</b>.
      A <b>Dictionary&lt;TKey,Ã‚Â TValue&gt;</b>'s most basic
      <b>public</b> methods are:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k7z0zy8k.aspx"><b>void
	  Add(TKey key, TValue value)</b></a>:  Associates the given
	  value with the given key.  If there is already a value
	  associated with the given key, it throws an
	  <b>ArgumentException</b>. </li>
<li> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kabs04ac.aspx"><b>bool
	  Remove(TKey key)</b></a>: Removes the given key and its
	  associated value from the dictionary, and returns whether
	  the key was found. </li>
<li> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb347013.aspx"><b>bool
	  TryGetValue(TKey key, out TValue value)</b></a>:  Returns
	  whether the given key is in the dictionary.  If so, the <a href="http://people.cs.ksu.edu/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/out-ref"><b>out</b>
	  parameter</a>
<tt>value</tt> is assigned the value associated with
	  <tt>key</tt>; otherwise, <tt>value</tt> is assigned the
	  default value for its type.
</li></ul>
The above methods can be used for building and updating a
    <b>Dictionary</b>, as well as for looking up values by their keys.
    It is also possible to do updates and lookups using indexing.
    Specifically, a key may be used as an index in a
    <b>Dictionary</b>, as if the <b>Dictionary</b> were an array.  For
    example, suppose that <tt>dictionary</tt> is a
    <b>Dictionary&lt;TKey,Ã‚Â TValue&gt;</b>, <tt>k</tt> is a
    <b>TKey</b>, and <tt>v</tt> is a <b>TValue</b>.  We can then do
    the following:
<pre>
dictionary[k] = v;
</pre>
This will associate the value <tt>v</tt> with the key <tt>k</tt>, as
    the <b>Add</b> method does; however, its behavior is slightly
    different if <tt>k</tt> already has a value associated with it.
    Whereas the <b>Add</b> method would throw an exception in this
    case, using the indexer will simply replace the value previously
    associated with <tt>k</tt> by the new value <tt>v</tt>.  Thus, we
    use the <b>Add</b> method when we expect the key to be a new key
    for the dictionary, but we use the indexer when we want to
    associate the value with the key, regardless of whether the key is
    already in the dictionary.
<p>
Likewise, we can use the indexer to look up a key:
</p>
<pre>
v = dictionary[k];
</pre>
Again, the behavior is similar to the <b>TryGetValue</b> method, but
    slightly different, as there is no <b>bool</b> in the above
    statement.  When using the indexer, if the key is not in the
    dictionary, it will throw a <b>KeyNotFoundException</b>.  Thus, we
    use the indexer when we expect the key to be in the dictionary,
    but we use the <b>TryGetValue</b> method when we don't know if the
    key is in the dictionary.
