<h1>Introduction to Trees</h1>

A <i>tree</i> is a mathematical structure having a hierarchical
    nature.  A tree may be <i>empty</i>, or it may consist of:
<ul>
<li> a <i>root</i>, and </li>
<li> zero or more <i>children</i>, each of which is also a tree. </li>
</ul>
Consider, for example, a folder (or directory) in a Windows file
    system.  This folder and all its sub-folders form a tree - the
    root of the tree is the folder itself, and its children are the
    folders directly contained within it.  (<b>Note:</b> We are only
    considering actual folders, not shortcuts, symbolic links, etc.).
    Because a folder (with its sub-folders) forms a tree, each of the
    sub-folders directly contained within the folder are also trees.  In
    this example, there are no empty trees - an empty folder is a
    nonempty tree containing a root but no children.
<p>
We have at least a couple of ways of presenting a tree graphically.
      One way is as done within Windows Explorer:
</p>
<img alt="A Windows file system tree" src="windows-tree.jpg"/>
<p>
Here, children are shown in a vertically-aligned list, indented under
      the root.  An alternative depiction is as follows:
</p>
<img alt="A tree" src="tree-example.jpg"/>
<p>
Here, children are shown by drawing lines to them downward from the
      root.
</p>
Other examples of trees include various kinds of search spaces.  For
    example, for a chess-playing program, the search for a move can be
    performed on a game tree whose root is a board position and whose
    children are the game trees formed from each board position
    reachable from the root position by a single move.  Also, in the
    sections that follow, we will consider various data structures
    that form trees.  
<p></p> 

The .NET Framework provides access to the folders in a file system
    tree via the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.directoryinfo.aspx"><b>DirectoryInfo</b></a>
    class, found in the <b>System.IO</b> namespace.  This class has a
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.directoryinfo.directoryinfo.aspx">constructor</a>
    that takes as its only parameter a <b>string</b> giving the path
    to a folder (i.e., a directory) and constructs a
    <b>DirectoryInfo</b> describing that folder.  We can obtain such a
    <b>string</b> from the user using a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.folderbrowserdialog(v=vs.110).aspx"><b>FolderBrowserDialog</b></a>.
    This class is similar to a <a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/file-dialogs">file
    dialog</a> and can be added to a form in the Design window in the
    same way.  If <tt>uxFolderBrowser</tt> is a
    <b>FolderBrowserDialog</b>, we can use it to obtain a
    <b>DirectoryInfo</b> for a user-selected folder as follows:
<pre>
if (uxFolderBrowser.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)
{
    DirectoryInfo folder = new DirectoryInfo(uxFolderBrowser.SelectedPath);
    . . .
}
</pre>

Various properties
    of a <b>DirectoryInfo</b> give information about the folder; for
    example:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.directoryinfo.name.aspx"><b>Name</b></a>
	  gets the name of the folder as a <b>string</b>. </li>
<li> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.filesysteminfo.fullname.aspx"><b>FullName</b></a>
	  gets the full path of the folder as a <b>string</b>. </li>
<li> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.directoryinfo.parent.aspx"><b>Parent</b></a>
	  gets the parent folder as a <b>DirectoryInfo</b>. </li>
</ul>
In addition, its <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s7xk2b58.aspx"><b>GetDirectories</b></a>
      method takes no parameters and returns a
      <b>DirectoryInfo[ ]</b> whose elements describe the
      contained folders (i.e., the elements of the array are the
      children of the folder).  For example, if <tt>d</tt> refers to a
      <b>DirectoryInfo</b> for the folder <b>Ksu.Cis300.HelloWorld</b>
      from the figures above, then <b>d.GetDirectories()</b> would
      return a 3-element array whose elements describe the folders
      <b>bin</b>, <b>obj</b>, and <b>Properties</b>.  The following
      method illustrates how we can write the names of the folders
      contained within a given folder to a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.streamwriter(v=vs.110).aspx"><b>StreamWriter</b></a>:
<pre>
/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Writes the names of the directories contained in the given directory (excluding their
/// sub-directories) to the given StreamWriter.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="dir"&gt;The directory whose contained directories are to be written.&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;param name="output"&gt;The output stream to write to.&lt;/param&gt;
private void WriteSubDirectories(DirectoryInfo dir, StreamWriter output)
{
    foreach (DirectoryInfo d in dir.GetDirectories())
    {
        output.WriteLine(d.Name);
    }
}
</pre>
For a more interesting problem, suppose we want to write to a
    <b>StreamWriter</b> the structure of an entire folder, as follows:
<pre>
Ksu.Cis300.HelloWorld
  bin
    Debug
    Release
  obj
    Debug
      TempPE
  Properties
</pre>
We can break this task into the following steps:
<ol>
<li> Write the name of the folder:
<pre>
Ksu.Cis300.HelloWorld
</pre>
</li>
<li> Write the structure of each child folder, indented one level (i.e.,
	two spaces):
<ul>
<li> First child:
<pre>
  bin
    Debug
    Release
</pre>
</li>
<li> Second child:
<pre>
  obj
    Debug
      TempPE
</pre>
</li>
<li> Third child:
<pre>
  Properties
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<a name="recursion"></a>
Note that writing the structure of a child folder is an instance of
    the original problem that we want to solve - i.e., writing the
    structure of a folder.  The only difference is that the folders
    are different and the amount of indentation is different.  We can
    solve such a problem using a technique called <i>recursion</i>.
    Recursion involves a method calling itself.  Because of the
    recursive nature of a tree (i.e., each child of a tree is also a
    tree), recursion is commonly used in processing trees.
<p>
In order to use recursion, we first must define precisely what we want
      our method to accomplish, wherever it might be called.  For this
      problem, we want to write to a given <b>StreamWriter</b> a
      list of all the folders contained within a given folder,
      including the given folder itself and all sub-folders in the
      entire tree, where each folder is indented two spaces beyond its
      parent's indentation.  Furthermore, the entire tree below a
      given folder (i.e., excluding the folder itself) should be
      listed below that folder, but before any folders that are
      outside that folder.  In order to write such a method, we need
      three parameters:
<ul>
<li> a <b>DirectoryInfo</b> giving the root folder; </li>
<li> a <b>StreamWriter</b> where the output is to be written; and
      </li>
<li> an <b>int</b> giving the level of indentation for the
	root folder, where each level of indentation is two
	spaces. </li>
</ul>
Because the root folder must be written first, we begin there.  We
    first must write two blanks for every level of indentation, then
    write the name of the root folder:
<pre>
/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Writes the directory structure for the given root directory to the given StreamWriter,
/// indenting all entries to the given indentation level (incomplete).
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="root"&gt;The root directory.&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;param name="output"&gt;The output stream to which to write&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;param name="level"&gt;The current indentation level.&lt;/param&gt;
private void WriteTree(DirectoryInfo root, StreamWriter output, int level)
{
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; level; i++)
    {
        output.Write("  ");
    }
    output.WriteLine(root.Name);

    // We now need to write the sub-directories . . .

}
</pre>
We can get the children using <b>root.GetDirectories()</b>.  Each of
    the elements of the array this method returns will be a
    <b>DirectoryInfo</b> whose structure we want to write.  Looking
    back at how we described what we want the <b>WriteTree</b> method
    to accomplish, we see that it is exactly what we want to do for
    each child.  We can therefore make a recursive call for each
    child, specifying that the indentation level should be one deeper
    than the level for <tt>root</tt>:
<pre>
/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Writes the directory structure for the given root directory to the given StreamWriter,
/// indenting all entries to the given indentation level (incomplete).
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="root"&gt;The root directory.&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;param name="output"&gt;The output stream to which to write&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;param name="level"&gt;The current indentation level.&lt;/param&gt;
private void WriteTree(DirectoryInfo root, StreamWriter output, int level)
{
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; level; i++)
    {
        output.Write("  ");
    }
    output.WriteLine(root.Name);
    foreach (DirectoryInfo d in root.GetDirectories())
    {
        WriteTree(d, output, level + 1);
    }
}
</pre>
This method accomplishes the desired task, provided the directory tree
    does not contain symbolic links or anything similar that might be
    represented using a <b>DirectoryInfo</b>, but is not an actual
    folder.  While it is possible to detect these and avoid following
    them, we will not consider that here.
<p>
There is something that may seem mysterious about what we have done.
      In order to convince ourselves that this method is written
      correctly, we need to know that the recursive calls work
      correctly; however, the recursive calls are to the same method.
      Our reasoning therefore seems circular.  However, we are
      actually using a mathematical principle from the discipline of
      formally proving software correctness: in order to prove that a
      recursive method meets its specification we may assume that any
      recursive calls meet that same specification, provided that
      these recursive calls are all on smaller problem instances.  
</p>
The restriction that recursive calls are on smaller problem instances
    is what avoids circular reasoning regarding recursion.  We
    associate with each problem instance a nonnegative integer
    describing its size.  For a problem involving a tree, this size is
    typically the number of <i>nodes</i> in the tree, where a node is
    a root of some subtree.  Because every node in a child is also
    in the tree containing the child, but the root of the containing
    tree is not in the child, a child is always smaller, provided the
    tree is finite.  (For directory trees, if the underlying file
    system is a Windows system, the tree will be finite; however if it
    is a non-Windows system, the trees may appear to Windows as being
    infinite - the above method actually will not work in such cases.)
    <p>
      The validity of this strategy is based on the fact that for any
      method, the following three statements cannot be simultaneously
      true:
    </p>
<ol>
<li>
	All of the method's recursive calls (if there are any)
	are on inputs of smaller size, where the size is defined to be
	a nonnegative integer.
      </li>
<li>
	When the method is given any input, if all of the method's
	recursive calls produce 
	correct results, then the method itself produces a correct result.
      </li>
<li>
	There is at least one input for which the method does not
	produce a correct result.
      </li>
</ol>
    Thus, if we can ensure that Statements 1 and 2 are true, then
    Statement 3 must be false; i.e., the method will be correct.  To
    ensure Statement 2, we only need to concern ourselves with cases
    in which all recursive calls produce correct results; hence, we
    simply assume that each recursive call produces correct results.
    <p>
To see why the three statements above cannot be simultaneously true,
      let's first suppose Statement 3 is true.  Let <i>S</i> be the
      set of all inputs for which the method does not produce a
      correct result.  Then because Statement 3 is true, this set is
      nonempty.  Because each input in <i>S</i> has a nonnegative
      integer size, there is an input <i>I</i> in <i>S</i> with
      smallest size.  Now suppose Statement 1 is true.  Then when the
      method is run on input <i>I</i>, each of the recursive calls is
      given an input smaller than <i>I</i>; hence, because <i>I</i> is
      a smallest input in <i>S</i>, none of these
      inputs is in <i>S</i>.  Therefore, each of the recursive calls
      produces a correct result.  We therefore have an input, <i>I</i>
      on which all of the method's recursive calls produce correct
      results, but the method itself does not produce a correct
      result.  Statement 2 is therefore false.
</p>
Once we understand this strategy, recursion is as easy to use as
    calling a method written by someone else.  In fact, we should
    treat recursive calls in exactly the same way - we need to
    understand what the recursive call is supposed to accomplish, but not
    necessarily how it accomplishes it.  Furthermore, because
    processing trees typically involves solving the same problem for
    multiple nodes in the tree, recursion is the natural technique to
    use.
<p>
A recursive method for processing a tree will break down into cases,
      each fitting into one of the following categories:
</p>
<ul>
<li> A <i>base case</i> is a case that is simple enough that a
	recursive call is not needed.  Empty trees are always base
	cases, and sometimes other trees are as
	well. </li>
<li> A <i>recursive case</i> is a case that requires one or more
	recursive calls to handle it. </li>
</ul>
A recursive method will always contain cases of <i>both</i> these
    types.  If there were no base cases, the recursion would never
    terminate.  If there were no recursive cases, the method wouldn't
    be recursive.  Most recursive methods are, in fact, structured as
    an <b>if</b>-statement, with some cases being base cases and some
    cases being recursive cases.  However, for some recursive methods,
    such as <b>WriteTree</b> above, the base cases aren't as
    obvious.  Note that in that method, the recursive call appears in
    a loop; hence, if the loop doesn't iterate (because the array
    returned is empty), no recursive calls are made.  Furthermore, if
    the directory tree is finite, there must be some sub-directories
    that have no children.  When the <b>GetDirectories</b> method is
    called for such a directory, it returns an empty array.  These
    directories are therefore the base cases.
<p></p>
The <b>WriteTree</b> method above is actually an example of processing
    an entire tree using a <i>preorder traversal</i>.  In a preorder
    traversal, the root of the tree is processed first, then each of
    the children is processed using a recursive call.  This results in
    each node's being processed prior to any node contained in any of
    its children.  For the <b>WriteTree</b> method, this means that
    the name of any folder is written before any folders contained
    anywhere within it.
<p>
When debugging a recursive method, we should continue to think about
      it in the same way - that is, assume that all recursive calls
      work correctly.  In order to isolate an error, we need to find
      an instance that causes an error, but whose recursive calls all
      work correctly.  It will almost always be possible to find such
      a case that is small - in fact, small cases tend to be the most
      likely ones to fit this description.  When debugging, it
      therefore makes sense to start with the smallest cases, and
      slowly increase their size until one is found that causes an
      error.  When using the debugger to step through code, first
      delete all breakpoints from this method, then use <a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/debugger-buttons">Step
      Over</a> to step over the recursive calls.  If a recursive call
      doesn't work correctly, you have found a smaller instance that
      causes an error - work on that instance instead.  Otherwise, you
      can focus on the top-level code for the instance you are
      debugging.  This is much easier to think about that trying to
      work through different levels of recursion.
</p>
There are times when it is useful to know exactly what happens when a
    recursive call (or any method call, for that matter) is made.
    Prior to transferring control to the top of the method being
    called, all local variables and the address of the current code
    location are pushed onto the <i>call stack</i>.  This call stack
    is just like any other stack, except that it has a smaller amount
    of space available to it.  You can, in fact, examine the call
    stack when debugging - from the "Debug" menu, select
    "Windows ‑&gt; Call Stack".  This will open a
    window showing the contents of the call stack.  The line on top
    shows the line of code currently ready for execution.  Below it is
    the line that called the current method, and below that line is
    the line that called that method, etc.  By double-clicking on an
    entry in the call stack, you can use the other debugging tools to
    examine the values of the local variables for the method
    containing that line of code.  If this method is recursive, the
    values displayed for the local variables are their values at that
    level of recursion.  Note that this only applies to the values
    stored in local variables - in particular, if a local variable is a
    <a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/reference-value">reference
    type</a>, the value of the object to which it refers will not
    revert to its earlier state.  For example, if a local variable is
    an array, the debugger will show the value of this variable to
    refer to the array that it referred to at that point, but the
    values shown in that array will be its current values.
<p>
Once consequence of method calls using a call stack with limited space
      available is that moderately deep recursion can fill up the call
      stack.  If this happens, a <b>StackOverflowException</b> will be
      thrown.  Thus, infinite recursion will always throw this
      exception, as will recursion that is nested too deeply.  For
      this reason, it is usually a bad idea to use recursion on a <a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/linked-lists">linked
      list</a> - if the list is very long, the recursion will be
      nested too deeply.  We must also take care in using recursion
      with trees, as long paths in a tree can lead to a
      <b>StackOverflowException</b>.  Due to the branching nature of
      trees, however, we can have very large trees with no long
      paths.  In fact, there are many cases in which we can
      be sure that a tree doesn't contain any long paths.  In such
      cases, recursion is often a useful technique.
