<h1>Inorder Traversal</h1>

When we store keys and values in an ordered dictionary, we typically
    want to be able to process the
    keys in increasing order.  The "processing" that we do
    may be any of a number of things - for example, writing the keys
    and values
    to a file or adding them to the end of a list.  Whatever
    processing we want to do, we want to do it 
    increasing order of keys.
<p>
If we are implementing the dictionary using a binary search tree, this
      may at first seem to be a rather daunting task.  Consider
      traversing the keys in the following binary search tree in
      increasing order:

Processing these keys in order involves frequent jumps in the tree,
    such as from 17 to 23 and from 41 to 54.  It may not be
    immediately obvious how to proceed.  However, if we just think
    about it with the purpose of writing a recursive method, it
    actually becomes rather straightforward.
<p>
As with most tree-processing algorithms, if the given tree is
      nonempty, we start at the root (if it is empty, there are no
      nodes to process).
      However, the root isn't necessarily the first node that we want
      to process, as there may be keys that are smaller than the one
      at the root.  These keys are all in the left child.  We therefore
      want to process first all the nodes in the left child, in
      increasing order of their keys.  This is a smaller instance of
      our original problem - a recursive call on the left child solves
      it.  At this point all of the keys less than the one at the root
      have been processed.  We therefore process the root next
      (whatever the "processing" might be).  This just leaves the
      nodes in the right child, which we want to process in increasing
      order of their keys.  Again, a recursive call takes care of
      this, and we are finished.
</p>
The entire algorithm is therefore as follows:
<ul>
<li> If the given tree is nonempty:
<ul>
<li> Do a recursive call on the left child to process all the nodes
	    in it. </li>
<li> Process the root. </li>
<li> Do a recursive call on the right child to process all the nodes
	    in it. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
This algorithm is known as an <i>inorder traversal</i> because it
    processes the root between the processing of the two children.  Unlike <a
    href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/trees-intro">preorder
    traversal</a>, this algorithm only makes sense for binary trees,
    as there must be exactly two children in order for "between" to
    make sense.
