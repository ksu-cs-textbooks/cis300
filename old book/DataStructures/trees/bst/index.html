We motivated our discussion of trees by expressing a need for a linked
      data structure that supports a binary search or something
      similar.  We will present such a data structure - a binary
      search tree - in this
      section.  While it will support efficient lookups, insertions,
      and deletions for many applications, we will see that there are
      cases in which it performs no better than a linked list.  In <a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/avl-trees">the next
      section</a>, we will add some refinements that will guarantee
      good performance.
</p>
Before we can define a binary search tree, we need to define a more
    primitive structure, a <i>binary tree</i>.  We will then use
    binary trees to define binary search trees, and show how to build
    them and search them.  We will then show how to remove elements
    from them.  We conclude this section by presenting the <i>inorder
    traversal</i> algorithm, which processes all the elements in a
    binary search tree in order.
