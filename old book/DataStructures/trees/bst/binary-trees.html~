<h1>Binary Trees</h1>

A <i>binary tree</i> is a tree in which each node has exactly two
    children, either of which may be empty.  For example, the
    following is a binary tree:
<p>
<img src="binary-tree.jpg" alt="A binary tree">
</p>
Note that some of the nodes above are drawn with only one child or no
    children at all.  In these cases, one or both children are empty.
    Note that we always draw one child to the left and one child to
    the right.  As a result, if one child is empty, we can always tell
    which child is empty and which child is not.  We call the two
    children the <i>left</i> child and the <i>right</i> child.
<p>
We can implement a single node of a binary tree as a data structure
      and use it to store data.  The implementation is simple, like <a
      href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/linked-list-intro">the
      implementation of a linked list cell</a>.  Let's call this type
      <b>BinaryTreeNode&lt;T&gt;</b>, where <b>T</b> will be the type
      of data we will store in it.  We need three <b>public</b>
      properties:
<ul>
<li> a <b>Data</b> property of type <b>T</b>;</li>
<li> a <b>LeftChild</b> property of type
	<b>BinaryTreeNode&lt;T&gt;</b>; and </li>
<li> a <b>RightChild</b> property of type
	<b>BinaryTreeNode&lt;T&gt;</b>. </li>
</ul>
We can define both <b>get</b> and <b>set</b> accessors using the
    default implementation for each of these
    properties.  However, it is sometimes advantageous to make this
    type immutable.  In such a case, we would not define any
    <b>set</b> accessors,
    but we would need to be sure to define a constructor that takes
    three parameters to initialize these three properties.  While
    immutable nodes tend to degrade the performance slightly, they
    also tend to be easier to work with.  For example, with immutable
    nodes it is impossible to build a structure with a cycle in it.
