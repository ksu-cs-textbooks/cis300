<a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/binary-search">Binary
    search</a> provides an efficient way to find elements in a sorted
    array-like structure.  However, inserting or removing from an
    array-like structure can be expensive because all subsequent data
    elements must be moved to accommodate the change.  On the other
    hand, linked lists can be modified efficiently, provided we have a
    reference to the cell preceding the insertion or deletion point.
    However, finding a cell can be expensive because the only way to
    search a linked list is to start at the front and work through it
    a cell at a time.  We would like a data structure that provides
    both efficient lookups and efficient insertions and deletions.
<p>
To meet this challenge, we want a linked structure so that
      changes can be made cheaply by changing a few references.
      However, we want the individual cells in the structure to be
      arranged in a way that supports something like a binary search.
      The specific structure that we want is called a <i>binary search
      tree</i>, which is a particular kind of <i>tree</i>.
</p>
In this chapter, we will examine various kinds of trees.  We will
    start by defining trees and developing a strategy for processing
    them.  We will then present binary search trees, which will
    provide a partial solution to our challenge of finding a data
    structure to support efficient lookups, insertions, and
    deletions.  However, there will be cases in which binary search
    trees have poor performance.  We will therefore give a refinement
    known as AVL trees, which give good performance in all cases.  We
    will then examine two other uses of trees - tries and priority
    queues.
