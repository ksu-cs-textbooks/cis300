Often we need a data structure that supports efficient storage of data
    items and their subsequent retrieval in order of some
    pre-determined <i>priority</i>.  We have already seen two
    instances of such data structures: stacks and queues.  With a
    stack, the later the item is stored, the higher its priority.
    With a queue, the earlier the item is stored, the higher its
    priority.  More generally, we would like to be able to set
    priorities arbitrarily, in a way that may be unrelated to the
    order in which they were stored.
<p>
Suppose, for example, that we want to schedule tasks in a real-time
      computing environment.  Tasks that are more urgent would be
      given higher priorities.  Each time we need to decide which task
      is to be scheduled, we retrieve the task with the highest
      priority.
</p>
The general name for such a data structure is a <i>priority
      queue</i>.  Priority queues typically support the following
      operations:
<ul>
<li> Adding a data element, together with a priority. </li>
<li> Obtaining the number of data elements currently in the
	structure. </li>
<li> Obtaining the maximum of all priorities of elements in the
	structure. </li>
<li> Removing a data element having maximum priority. </li>
</ul>
Obviously, the last two operations above can only be done when the
    structure is nonempty.  A variation on the above focuses on
    minimum priority rather than maximum priority.  This variation is
    called a <i>min-priority queue</i>.  Because we will later cover
    applications of min-priority queues, we will focus on this
    variation in this section.  In the sub-sections that follow, we
    will first consider a general structure that can be used in
    various ways to give efficient priority queue implementations.  We
    will then look at one specific implementation.  We will conclude
    by giving an example of how min-priority queues are used in file
    compression algorithms.
