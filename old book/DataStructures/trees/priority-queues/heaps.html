<h1>Heaps</h1>

A common structure for implementing a priority queue is known as
a <i>heap</i>.  A heap is a tree whose nodes contain elements with
priorities that can be ordered.  Furthermore, if the heap is nonempty,
its root contains the maximum priority of any node in the heap, and
each of its children is also a heap.  Note that this implies that, in
any subtree, the maximum priority is at the root.  We define
a <i>min-heap</i> similarly, except that the minimum priority is at
the root.  Below is an example of a min-heap with integer priorities
(the data elements are not shown - only their priorities):

</p>
Note that this structure is different from a binary search tree, as
there are elements in the left child that have larger priorities than
the root.  Although some ordering is imposed on the nodes (i.e.,
priorities do not decrease as we go down a path from the root), the
ordering is less rigid than for a binary search tree.  As a result,
there is less overhead involved in maintaining this ordering; hence, a
min-heap tends to give better performance than an AVL tree, which
could also be used to implement a min-priority queue.  Although the
definition of a heap does not require it, the implementations we will
consider will be binary trees, as opposed to trees with an arbitrary
number of children.  (We should also point out that the heap data
structure is unrelated to the pool of memory from which instances of
reference types are constructed - this also, unfortunately, is called
a heap.)
<p>
One advantage to using a min-heap to implement a min-priority queue is
fairly obvious - an element with minimum priority is always at the
root if the min-heap is nonempty.  This makes it easy to find the
minimum priority and an element with this priority.
Let's consider how we might remove a element with minimum priority.
Assuming the min-heap is nonempty, we need to remove the element at
the root.  Doing so leaves us with two min-heaps (either of which
might be empty).  To complete the removal, we need a way to merge two
min-heaps into one.  Note that if we can do this, we also have a way
of adding a new element: we form a 1-node min-heap from the new
element and its priority, then merge this min-heap with the original
one.
</p>
Let us therefore consider the problem of merging two min-heaps into
one.  If either min-heap is empty, we can simply use the other one.
Suppose that both are nonempty.  Then the minimum priority of each is
located at its root.  The minimum priority overall must therefore be
the smaller of these two priorities.  Let <i>s</i> denote the heap
whose root has the smaller priority and <i>b</i> denote the heap whose
root has the larger priority.  Then the root of <i>s</i> should be the
root of the resulting min-heap.
<p>
Now that we have determined the root of the result, let's consider
what we have left.  <i>s</i> has two children, both of which are
min-heaps, and <i>b</i> is also a min-heap.  We therefore have three
min-heaps, but only two places to put them - the new left and right
children of <i>s</i>.  To reduce the number of min-heaps to two, we
can merge two of them into one.  This is simply a recursive call.
</p>
We have therefore outlined a general strategy for merging two
min-heaps.  There two important details that we have omitted, though:
<ul>
<li> Which two min-heaps do we merge in the recursive call? </li>
<li> Which of the two resulting min-heaps do we make the new left
  child of <i>s</i>? </li>
</ul>
There are various ways these questions can be answered.  Some ways
lead to efficient implementations, whereas others do not.  For
example, if we always merge the right child of <i>s</i> with <i>b</i>
and make the result the new right child of <i>s</i>, it turns out that
all of our min-heaps will have empty left children.  As a result, in
the worst case, the time needed to merge two min-heaps is proportional
to the total number of elements in the two min-heaps.  This is poor
performance.
In <a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/leftist-heaps">the next
  section</a> we will consider a specific implementation that results
in a worst-case running time proportional to the logarithm of the
total number of nodes.
