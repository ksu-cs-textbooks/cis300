Often in solving problems, we need to access data items in a
    particular order.  Consider, for example, the action of an "Undo"
    operation in a text editor, spreadsheet, or similar application.
    If we want to be able to undo a sequence of these operations, we need
    to record each operation as it is done. When we want to undo an
    operation, we need to retrieve the 
    operation to undo from the recorded sequence of operations.
    However, we don't 
    want to undo just any operation in this sequence - we need to undo the
    most recent one that hasn't yet been undone.  We therefore need to
    access the operations in <i>last-in-first-out</i>, or <i>LIFO</i>,
    order.  Other applications might need to access data items in
    <i>first-in-first-out</i>, or <i>FIFO</i>, order.  In this
    chapter, we will examine data structures that support these kinds
    of access.
