<h1>Parenthesis Matching</h1>

The problem of finding matching parentheses must be solved in many
    computing applications.  For example, consider a C# compiler.
    Matching parentheses ('(' and '('), brackets ('[' and ']'), and
    braces ('{' and '}') delimit various parts of the source code.  In
    order for these parts to be interpreted correctly, the compiler
    must be able to determine how these different kinds of parentheses
    match up with each other.  Another example is processing
    structured data stored in XML format.  Different parts of such a
    data set are delimited by nested begin tags like "&lt;summary&gt;"
    and end tags like "&lt;/summary&gt;" (documentation comments in C#
    code are in XML format).  These tags are essentially different
    kinds of parentheses that need to be matched.
<p>
We will restrict our attention to parentheses, brackets, and braces.
      We will call all six of these characters "parentheses", but will
      divide them into three types.  Each type then has an opening
      parenthesis and a closing parenthesis.
      We will define a <b>string</b> restricted to these six
      characters to be <i>matched</i> (or <i>balanced</i>) if we can
      repeatedly remove an opening parenthesis and a closing parenthesis
      of the same type to its immediate right until there are no more
      parentheses. 
</p>
For example, suppose we have the <b>string</b>,
    "<tt>([]{()[]})[{}]</tt>".  We can apply the matching-pair removal
    process described above as follows (blank space is inserted to
    make it easier to see which parentheses are removed):
<pre>
([]{()[]})[{}]
(  {()[]})[{}]
(  {  []})[{}]
(  {    })[{}]
(        )[{}]
          [{}]
          [  ]

</pre>
Hence, this <b>string</b> is matched.  On the other hand, consider the
    <b>string</b>, "<tt>([]{()[])}[{}]</tt>".  When we apply the above
    process to this <b>string</b>, we obtain:
<pre>
([]{()[])}[{}]
(  {()[])}[{}]
(  {  [])}[{}]
(  {    )}[{}]
(  {    )}[  ]
(  {    )}
</pre>
and we can go no further.  Hence, this <b>string</b> is not matched.
<p>
We can extend the definition of a matched <b>string</b> to include
      other characters if we first remove all other characters before
      we begin the matching-pair removal process.  In what
      follows, we will focus on the problem of determining whether a
      given <b>string</b> is matched.
</p>
The matching-pair removal process shown above gives us an algorithm
    for determining whether a <b>string</b> is matched.  However, if
    implemented directly, it isn't very efficient.  Changes to a
    <b>string</b> are inefficient because the entire <b>string</b>
    must be reconstructed.  We could use a <b>StringBuilder</b>, but
    even then, removing characters is inefficient, as all characters
    to the right of the removed character must be moved to take its
    place.  Even if we simply change parentheses to blanks, as we did
    in the above example, searching for matching pairs is still rather
    expensive.
<p>
What we would like to do instead is to find a way to apply the
      matching-pair removal process while scanning the <b>string</b>
      once.  As we are scanning the <b>string</b>, we don't want to
      spend time searching for a matching pair.  We can do this if,
      while scanning the <b>string</b>, we keep all unmatched opening
      parentheses in a stack.  Then the parenthesis at the top of the
      stack will always be the rightmost unmatched opening
      parenthesis.  Thus, starting with an empty stack, we do the
      following for each character in the <b>string</b>:
<ul>
<li> If the character is a opening parenthesis, push it onto the
	stack. </li>
<li> If the character is a closing parenthesis:
<ul>
<li> If the stack is nonempty, and the current character matches the
	    character on top of the stack, remove the character from
	    the top of the stack. </li>
<li> Otherwise, the <b>string</b> is not matched. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Ignore all other characters.
</li></ul>
If the stack is empty when the entire <b>string</b> has been
    processed, then the <b>string</b> is matched; otherwise, it is
    not.
<p>
For example, consider the <b>string</b>,
      "<tt>{a[b]([c]){de}}f[(g)]</tt>".  In what follows, we will
      simulate the above algorithm, showing the result of processing
      each character on a separate line.  The portion of the line with
      a grey background will be the stack contents, with the top
      element shown at the right.  We will insert blank space in the
      grey area for clarity, but the stack will only contain opening
      parentheses.  The first character with a white background is the
      character currently being processed.
<pre>
{a[b]([c]){de}}f[(g)]    --- an opening parenthesis - push it onto the stack
<span style="background-color:#e0e0e0">{</span>a[b]([c]){de}}f[(g)]    --- ignore
<span style="background-color:#e0e0e0">{ </span>[b]([c]){de}}f[(g)]    --- push onto stack
<span style="background-color:#e0e0e0">{ [</span>b]([c]){de}}f[(g)]    --- ignore
<span style="background-color:#e0e0e0">{ [ </span>]([c]){de}}f[(g)]    --- closing parenthesis that matches the top - remove top
<span style="background-color:#e0e0e0">{    </span>([c]){de}}f[(g)]    --- push onto stack
<span style="background-color:#e0e0e0">{    (</span>[c]){de}}f[(g)]    --- push onto stack
<span style="background-color:#e0e0e0">{    ([</span>c]){de}}f[(g)]    --- ignore
<span style="background-color:#e0e0e0">{    ([ </span>]){de}}f[(g)]    --- a match - remove top
<span style="background-color:#e0e0e0">{    (   </span>){de}}f[(g)]    --- a match - remove top
<span style="background-color:#e0e0e0">{         </span>{de}}f[(g)]    --- push onto stack
<span style="background-color:#e0e0e0">{         {</span>de}}f[(g)]    --- ignore
<span style="background-color:#e0e0e0">{         { </span>e}}f[(g)]    --- ignore
<span style="background-color:#e0e0e0">{         {  </span>}}f[(g)]    --- a match - remove top
<span style="background-color:#e0e0e0">{             </span>}f[(g)]    --- a match - remove top
<span style="background-color:#e0e0e0">               </span>f[(g)]    --- ignore
<span style="background-color:#e0e0e0">                </span>[(g)]    --- push onto stack
<span style="background-color:#e0e0e0">                [</span>(g)]    --- push onto stack
<span style="background-color:#e0e0e0">                [(</span>g)]    --- ignore
<span style="background-color:#e0e0e0">                [( </span>)]    --- a match - remove top
<span style="background-color:#e0e0e0">                [   </span>]    --- a match - remove top
<span style="background-color:#e0e0e0">                     </span>    --- end of string and stack empty - matched string
</pre>
If at any time during the above process we had encountered a closing
    parenthesis while the stack was empty, this would have indicated
    that this closing parenthesis has no matching opening parenthesis.
    In this case, we would have stopped immediately, determining that
    the <b>string</b> is not matched.  Likewise, if we had encountered
    a closing parenthesis that did not match the parentheis at the top
    of the stack, this would have indicated a mismatched pair.
    Again, we would have stopped immediately.  Finally, if we had
    reached the end of the <b>string</b> with a nonempty stack, this
    would have indicated that we had at least one opening parenthesis
    that was never matched.  We would have again determined that the
    <b>string</b> is not matched.
