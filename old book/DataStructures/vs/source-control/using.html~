<h1>Using Source Control</h1>

To create a new solution under source control, proceed as you normally
      would, but in the "New Project" dialog, select as the location a
      new folder (named something like "Lab 2" or "Homework 3", as
      appropriate) within the folder you selected when you configured
      your workspace above, and check the "Add to source control" box.
      
<p></p> 

To add an existing solution to source control, you will first need to
      make sure that it is located within your source control folder
      (you can move the entire containing folder if necessary).  Then
      open that solution, and in 
      the Solution Explorer, right-click on the solution name, and
      select "Add Solution to Source Control..." from the resulting
      popup menu.  

<p></p>
Simply placing a solution under source control won't upload anything to
    the server - it just defines
      this solution as one you want to manage.
When you have code that you want to upload, either to submit it for
      grading or just to
      checkpoint it, from the Solution Explorer, right-click on the
      solution name and click, "Check In...".  This will open the Team
      Explorer showing Pending Changes.  In the "Comment" section, you
      can provide a comment.  This comment should be descriptive of
      this version of the program so that you can find it later if you
      are looking for it.  Then click the "Check In" button, and click
      "Yes" on the resulting Check-in Confirmation dialog.  This will
      upload this version of your solution to your Visual Studio
      account.  As you are editing your code, you can periodically
      check in versions in this way so that you can access them later
      if need be (there is no limit to the storage available to you on
      your Visual Studio account).  Within the Solution Explorer, a
      blue "Checked-in" icon will appear next to each part of your
      solution that is unchanged since its last check-in, and a red
      "Checked-out" icon will appear next to each part that has been
      changed since its last check-in.  Thus, you can readily tell if
      your entire solution has been uploaded - there will be a blue
    "Checked-in" icon next to each source code file.
<p></p>
If you want to access your checked-in code from a different machine,
      first open Visual Studio, then open the Team Explorer window
      (you can always find it via the View menu if you don't see a tab
      for it).  In the Team Explorer, click on the "Manage
    Connections" icon at the top:
<p>
<img src="manage-connections.jpg" 
alt="A picture of the Team Explorer window should appear here.">
</p>
Then click on the "Manage Connections" link, and select "Connect to
    Team Project" from the resultion popup menu.  In the resulting
    dialog, click the "Servers..." 
      button in the upper right-hand corner.  In the subsequent
      dialog, click the "Add..." button in the upper right-hand
      corner.  This will open yet another dialog, in which you can
      type the URL of your Visual Studio account.  Then click the
      "OK" button.  You will then be prompted for the user name
      (i.e., your email address) and
      password for your Visual Studio account.  Once you have signed
      in, you can close the "Add/Remove Team Foundation Server"
      dialog.  At this point, the "Connect to Team Foundation Server"
      dialog will list your source control projects - check the box
      next to the one you want (there will probably only be one), and
      click the "Connect" button.  You will then need to configure
      your workspace as outlined in step 7 above.  This will download
      the contents of the project to your workspace.  Furthermore,
      if you subsequently check in a solution on one machine, you can
      propagate the changes to the other as follows:
<ul>
<li> Open the solution on the machine you want to update.</li>
<li> In the Solution Explorer, right-click on the solution name, and select
      "Get Latest Version (Recursive)".</li>
</ul>
You can also access the latest version of any solution via the Source
    Control Explorer, which you can access from the Team Explorer
    window (if you don't see it, click the icon that looks like a
    house at the top, and it should appear).  This window allows you
    to browse all projects on your Visual Studio account.  You can
    open the latest version of any solution by double-clicking it.
<p>
Now suppose that at some point in writing a program, you decide you
      want to look at an earlier version that you checked in.  There
      are several ways to do this.  First, you can
      right-click on the 
      file you want in the Solution Explorer and select
      "Source&nbsp;Control&#8209;&gt;View&nbsp;History".  This will open a
      window listing the different versions of this file, together
      with the date and time each was checked in and the comment that
      was supplied for the check-in.  One way of viewing a specific
      version is to right-click on that entry in the list and select
      "Compare..." from the popup menu.  This will open a window
      displaying the checked-in version of this file on the left and
      the current version on the right.  Code that was removed from
      the checked-in version is highlighted in pink, and code in the
      current version that has been added is highlighted in green.
      Code can be copy-pasted from the earlier version to the current
      version.
</p>
Sometimes you may want to revert back to an earlier version of a
    file.  First, it would be a good idea to check in the current
    version, just in case (this also tends to avoid conflicts that you
    may need to resolve).  To obtain an earlier version of a file, go
    back to the History window for that file, 
    right-click on the version you want, and select "Get This
    Version".  That version will then be opened in Visual Studio as
    the current version.
<p></p>
Alternatively, you may want to revert an entire solution to an earlier
    version.  To do this, right-click on the solution in the Solution
    Explorer, and select
    "Source&nbsp;Control&#8209;&gt;Get&nbsp;Specific&nbsp;Version...".    If
    you want to revert back to the latest version that was checked in
    by a specific date and time, in the resulting dialog, set the type
    to "Date", fill in the date and time you want, and click the "Get"
    button.  Or if you want to browse the available changesets, set the type to
    "Changeset", click the "..." button, optionally narrow down your
    search by a range of changeset numbers or times, and click the
    "Find" button.  This will list all matching changesets, together
    with their checkin times and comments.  Select the one you want
    to revert to by double-clicking, then clicking the "Get" button.
<p>
If you check in a solution after you have reverted to an earlier
      version, conflicts may be detected.  To resove these conflicts,
      you will usually want to click the "Keep Local Version" button.
      This will cause the current version you are working on to be
      checked in as the current version on the server.  (Nothing on
      the server will be deleted - you can still revert back to other
      versions.)  Once you have resolved the conflicts, you will need
      to try to check it in again.
</p>
It is important to realize that once you have checked in files, they
    are difficult to delete by accident.  Thus, frequent
    check-ins might save you from a number of problems that might
    occur.
<p>
There are a lot of other things you can do with source control, but
      most are useful mainly for collaboration on projects.  The
      functionality described here is likely sufficient for your needs
      in CIS 300.
