<h1>Troubleshooting Source Control</h1>

    One of the advantages of source control is that it provides a
    reliable repository of all the work you have checked in.  Once you
    have successfully checked in a version of a solution, it will
    remain available on the Team Foundation Server.  However, for a
    variety of reasons, it occasionally becomes difficult to check in
    what you need to.  This section gives some tips on troubleshooting
    check-in difficulties.
    <p>
      Often the easiest way to troubleshoot a check-in problem is to
      copy the folder containing your solution (e.g., the folder named
      "Homework 2") to a new folder (e.g., "Homework 2 Redo") within
      your workspace.  Then open the new copy of the solution, add it
      to source control, and try checking it in.  If this check-in is
      successful, the checked in code will appear in the new folder
      (e.g., "Homework 2 Redo") on the server, and any previously
      checked-in code will appear in the old folder (e.g., "Homework
      2").  Don't worry about trying either to delete the old folder
      or to give the new folder the proper name.
    </p>
    Sometimes Visual Studio will fail to check in a solution because
    it is trying to check in one or more files that it can't find.
    Usually, these are files that you don't even want to check in,
    often because you have deleted them.  To tell Visual Studio to
    ignore these files, look in the Pending Changes window of the Team
    Explorer (i.e., the window that appears when you try to check in a
    solution), and find the section, "Included Changes".  For any
    file(s) that should not be checked in, right-click on the file,
    and select "Exclude" from the resulting popup menu.  This will
    remove that file from the "Included Changes" list, and place it in
    the "Excluded Changes" list below, so that Visual Studio will not
    try to check it in.
    <p>
      Similarly, if a file you want to check in does not get checked
      in with the rest of the solution, it might be because it is in
      the "Excluded Changes" list.  To move it back to the "Included
      Changes" list, right-click on its entry in the "Excluded Changes"
      list, and select "Include" from the resulting popup menu.
