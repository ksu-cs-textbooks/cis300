Source control systems are powerful mechanisms for teams of
    programmers and other collaborators to manage multiple copies of
    various source files that all may be modifying.  CIS 300 does not
    involve teamwork, but we will be using it
    as a mechanism for assignment submission - your "collaborators"
    will be the graders.  There are several
    benefits to using the source control provided by Visual Studio:
<ul>
<li> It is more reliable than K-State Online. </li>
<li> It is easy to ensure that all required files have been
	submitted. </li>
<li> It is easy to "checkpoint"
	your programs - if at some point you discover you've gone down
	a wrong path and want to retrieve code that you have since
	modified, you can do this easily. </li>
<li> You can access your checked-in code from any machine with Visual
	Studio 2015 and internet access. </li>
<li> You will get an introduction to a technology that's indispensable
	for the professional programmer. </li>
</ul>
In this class, you will be using Microsoft's Team Foundation Version
    Control.  This source control system uses a Team Foundation Server
    to store the code under source control.  When you set up source
    control, you will define a web address where your Team Foundation
    Server will manage your code.  Only you and your collaborators
    (i.e., the graders) will have access to your code.
<p>
The code managed on a Team Foundation Server is organized into
      <i>projects</i>.  These projects are different from Visual
      Studio projects (see "<a
      href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/new-project">Visual
      Studio Projects</a>").  In particular, all of your code for this
      class will be placed in the same Team Foundation Server project.
      This project will be <i>mapped</i> to a <i>workspace</i>, which
      is simply a folder, on each of your local machines (i.e., the
      server you use in lab and any of your own machines you want to
      use).  The workspace will mirror the files and folders in the
      project mapped to it, although the workspace may also contain
      files and folders that have not been uploaded to the project.
</p>
The Team Foundation Server provides much more functionality than
    simply a mirror for your workspace.  The main feature we will be
    using is that whenever new versions of a file or folder are
    uploaded, they don't replace the old version - all uploaded versions are
    maintained with timestamps giving the dates and times when they
    were uploaded.  Because these timestamps are maintained by the
    remote server, they are trustworthy evidence of when the files
    were uploaded.
<p>
Because the Team Foundation Server keeps all versions of a file or
      folder, deleting, moving, or renaming a file or folder after it
      has been uploaded is problematic.  In fact, it is something that
      should be avoided.  If something needs to be renamed or deleted
      after it has been uploaded, it is often best to make a copy of
      the entire folder (named something like, "Lab 3 - redo") and
      make the required changes before uploading the new folder.
    </p>
    The remainder of this section describes how to set up, use, and
    troubleshoot source control.
