<h1>Submitting Assignments</h1>
<p>
      To submit a lab or homework assignment in CIS 300, you will need
      to do the following 
      steps:
    </p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Refresh</b> the changes tracked by Git.  Do this by
	going to the Team Explorer and clicking on the circular arrow
	icon (i.e.,
	<img alt="A picture of an icon should appear here." src="git-refresh-icon.JPG"/>) at the top.
	Note that this refresh is normally done automatically;
	however, it occasionally is not.  Doing this manual refresh
	helps to ensure that all of your code gets uploaded.
      </li>
<li>
<b>Commit</b> your changes to your local Git repository.  Do
	this by clicking the icon that looks like a pencil at the
	bottom of the Visual Studio window.  The Team Explorer will
	now show a window titled, "Changes".  In the yellow box, type
	in a message to be associated with the changes you are
	committing.  Then click "Commit All".
      </li>
<li>
<b>Push</b> your committed changes to GitHub.  Do this by
	clicking the up-arrow icon at the bottom of the Visual
	Studio window.  This will cause the Team Explorer to open.
	Click the "Push" link to push the repository to GitHub.  Note
	that <i>only committed changes will be pushed</i>.
      </li>
<li>
<b>Submit</b> the URL of the commit you want graded and (for lab
	assignments) your completed or attempted code using the
	submission form provided in the assignment instructions.  This
	requires the following steps:
	<ol type="a">
<li>
	    To reveal the submission form, click the "Submit
	Assignment" button at the top of the assignment instructions.
	This will cause the submission form to appear at the bottom of
	    the page.
	  </li>
<li>
	Reload the GitHub repository for this assignment in your web
	browser, and click on 
	the link showing the number of commits (this is just above the
	thick green horizontal line).  This will show a list of
	commits, beginning with the latest.  To the right of each
	commit is a button labeled "&lt;&gt;".  This button links to a
	web page displaying the entire contents of that commit.  (It's
	a good idea to check to see that all of your source code files
	are present, in case something went wrong.)  The
	URL of this page will end in a 40-digit hexadecimal number
	giving a digital fingerprint of the commit.  Copy this URL to
	the submission form.
      </li>
<li>
	For a lab assignment, enter your completed code (8 digits) or your
	attempted code (4 digits) into the Comments box in the assignment
	submission form.  (You don't need to enter anything in this
	box for a homework assignment.) If you need to provide
	additional information with your submission, you can do so in
	this box.
      </li>
<li>
	To complete your submission, click the "Submit Assignment"
	button in the assignment submission form.  The time at which
	this button was clicked will be the official submission time
	for your assignment.
      </li>
</ol>
</li></ol>
      Note that it is important to do all four of these steps in this
      order.  In particular, if you make any changes between your last
      commit and the push, these changes won't be included in the
      submission.  You can double-check that all changes have been
      pushed by looking at the numbers next to the up-arrow and pencil
      icons at the bottom of the Visual Studio window.  If all changes
    have been pushed, both numbers should be 0.  It is also important
      to include the correct URL.  In particular, the digital
      fingerprint of the commit is the only reliable evidence we have
      that the commit was made prior to the form submission; hence,
      this digital fingerprint is required in order for you to receive
    any credit for the assignment.
    <p>
      Occasionally, problems can occur with the interface between
      Visual Studio and GitHub.  These problems can prevent your code
      from being pushed to GitHub.  While the problems can often be
      fixed, it is often easier to bypass Visual Studio altogether,
      and use GitHub's file upload mechanism.  Please note that this is
      not the preferred assignment submission procedure because it is
      less automated (and hence more error-prone), and it creates a
      commit on GitHub that is not in your local git repository.
      However, it can be used if the above 
      procedure doesn't work for you.  To use this alternative
      submission procedure, do the following steps:
    </p>
<ol>
<li>
	If Visual Studio is running, exit this application, making
	sure all files are saved.
      </li>
<li>
	In your web browser, navigate to the repository for the
	assignment you are submitting.  You should see a list of files
	and folders, including a file whose name ends with ".sln".
      </li>
<li>
	In your Windows file browser, navigate to your project folder
	for this assignment.  You should see the same list of files
	and folders as is shown in your web browser. (Depending
	on the settings for your local machine, you may not see file
	name suffixes such as ".sln" and ".gitignore", and if you've
	added any projects that were not in the original repository,
	their folders may be shown in the file browser but not in the
	web browser.)
      </li>
<li>
	In your web browser, click the "Upload files" button in the
	row of buttons above the list of files and folders.
      </li>
<li>
	In your file browser, type Control-"A" to select all files and
	folders, and drag them to the web browser where it says, "Drag
	files here . . .".  The web browser should indicate a number
	of files being uploaded.
      </li>
<li>
	Near the bottom of the web browser window, in the text box
	below "Commit changes", type a commit message, then click the
	"Commit changes" at the bottom.  It may take a little while to
	process, but eventually you should see the repository again.
      </li>
<li>
	Make sure all of your ".cs" files are present in the GitHub
	repository, and that they 
	contain the code you want.  (If you have removed or renamed
	any files, the original files may still be in the repository;
	however, they shouldn't be in the solution, and therefore
	shouldn't interfere with the program's execution.)
      </li>
<li>
	Submit the URL of this commit by following Step 4 above.
      </li>
</ol>
