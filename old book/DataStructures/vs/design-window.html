<h1>The Design Window</h1>

    The Design Window in Visual Studio is a window used to build
    graphical components.  To open the Design Window for a graphical
    component, double-click on the component's file name in the Solution
    Explorer.  If you are working through the example from the
    previous two sections, double-click "UserInterface.cs" to open its
    Design Window.  It will initially contain a blank form:
<p>
<img alt="A picture of a portion of the design window should appear here." src="blank-form.jpg"/>
</p>
If you click on this blank form, handles will appear on its right and
    bottom edges and its lower-right corner.  You can resize the form
    by dragging these handles.  You can also change the title of the
    form ("Form1" in the picture above) as follows:
<ol>
<li> Click on the form. </li>
<li> Open its Properties window by clicking on the "Properties" tab at the
	right, below the "Solution Explorer" tab (if you don't see
	this tab, you can always get to this window from the "View"
	menu). </li>
<li> Look at the row of buttons near the top of
      the properties window, and make sure the second and third button
      are highlighted:
<p>
<img alt="A picture of a portion of a Properties window should appear
      here." src="properties.jpg"/>
</p>
If either of these buttons isn't highlighted, click it to highlight
      it.  The first two buttons on this row toggle whether the
      the information is arranged by category (the first button) or
      alphabetically (the second button).  The next two buttons toggle
      whether the control's properties (the third button) or events
      (the fourth button - we'll discuss these below) are shown. </li>
<li> Find "Text" in the left column of the Properties window - it will
	probably be highlighted.  Click on the space to its right, and
	edit the text to give your desired title.  If you are working
      through the example, give it a title of "Hello".</li>
</ol>
For example, after resizing and changing the title, we might have a
    form that looks like this:
<p>
<img alt="A picture of a portion of the design window should appear here." src="hello-start.jpg"/>
</p>
To add various graphical controls to the form, we use the Toolbox,
    which is normally available via a tab on the left edge (if not,
    you can always access it via the "View" menu).  For example,
    let's add a box that will contain text generated by
    the program.  We open the Toolbox and click on the <b>TextBox</b>
    control, which can be found in the "Common Controls" section.  We
    can then click on the design window (outside of the form) to bring
    it to the front, and drag an area on the form that we would like
    the <b>TextBox</b> to fill.  After doing so, there will be a
    handle on the right and left edges to allow horizontal resizing
    (don't worry about vertical resizing yet).  You can also drag the
    <b>TextBox</b> to adjust its location.  If you do this, as the
    edges of the <b>TextBox</b> approach the edges of the frame, struts
    will appear, helping you to leave an appropriate margin.
<p>
After adding a control, we usually need to customize it to some
      degree.  To do this, click on it, then open the Properties
      window again.  This window will now display the properties of
      the <b>TextBox</b>.  The first property we will always want to
      change is the name of the variable that the program will use to
      refer to this control.  This property is called "(Name)", and
      will be near the top.  You will need to change this name so that
      it follows the <a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/naming">naming
      convention</a> for controls on forms.   
</p>
<p>
There are various properties that can be changed to customize the
      appearance and behavior of a control.  For example, we can
      change the font of a <b>TextBox</b> by changing its <b>Font</b>
      property.  This in turn will affect the height of the
      <b>TextBox</b>.  We can prevent the user from editing it by
      setting its <b>ReadOnly</b> property to <b>True</b>.  If we want
      to allow multiple lines, we can set its <b>Multiline</b>
      property to <b>True</b>.  This in turn will add handles to the
      top and bottom edges so that we can adjust its height.  All of
      the properties of a GUI control are documented in that control's
      API documentation within the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229335.aspx">.NET
      Framework Class Library documentation</a>.
</p>
Thus, continuing the above example, if we modify the <b>TextBox</b>'s
    variable name to <tt>uxDisplay</tt>, its
    <b>Font</b> property to <b>Microsoft Sans Serif, 12pt</b> and its
    <b>ReadOnly</b> property to <b>True</b>, we would have the
    following form:
<p>
<img alt="A picture of a portion of the design window should appear
      here." src="hello-textbox.jpg"/>
</p>
Using a similar process, we can now add a <b>Button</b> to the form
    and name it <tt>uxGo</tt>.
    To change the text in the <b>Button</b>, we will need to change
    its <b>Text</b> property.  This might give us the following:
<p>
<img alt="A picture of a portion of the design window should appear
      here." src="hello-button.jpg"/>
</p>
Now that we have a <b>Button</b> on our form, it would be appropriate
    to provide some functionality for that <b>Button</b>.  Clicking on
    a <b>Button</b> signals an <i>event</i> to which our program may
    respond.  In order to cause our program to respond to such an
    event, we need to provide an <i>event handler</i> for it.  Because
    a mouse click is the default event for a <b>Button</b>, we can
    create an event handler for this event by simply double-clicking
    on the <b>Button</b>.  Doing so will open a <i>code window</i>
    containing the contents of the source code file defining the current
    form.  Furthermore, if the name of the <b>Button</b> is
    <tt>uxGo</tt>, the following method will have been added:
<pre>
private void uxGo_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{

}
</pre>
This method will be called whenever the <b>Button</b> is clicked (code
    causing this behavior will have been automatically added to the
    file containing the automatically-generated code for the form).
    Thus, to provide the appropriate functionality for the
    <b>Button</b> we just need to add code providing this
    functionality to this method.  We will discuss this in more detail
    in <a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/code-window">the
    next section</a>.
<p>
Before we leave the design window entirely, however, we need to talk
      about a more general way of accessing the event handlers
      associated with controls.  Going back to the Properties window
      for a control, clicking the fourth button in the row of buttons
      near the top (the one that looks like a lightning bolt) will
      cause all of the possible events for that control to be
      displayed, and any event handler that has been created for that
      event.  For example, if we have created the event handler
      described above, then the list of events for the
      <b>Button</b> looks like this:
</p>
<img alt="A picture of a portion of a Properties window should appear
      here." src="event-list.jpg"/>
<p>
This list is useful for two reasons.  The more obvious reason is that
      we sometimes might want to handle an event that is not the
      default event for a control.  For example, we might want a
      <b>Button</b> to react in some way (perhaps by changing color,
      for example) whenever the mouse enters or leaves it.  In order
      to implement this functionality, we would need event handlers
      for the <b>MouseEnter</b> and <b>MouseLeave</b> events.  We can
      add these event handlers by double-clicking these events in this
      list.
</p>
The less obvious use for this list is to remove an event handler.
    Often we find that we have added an event handler that we don't
    need, perhaps by double-clicking in the wrong place.  When this
    happens, we shouldn't just delete the code, because there is
    other automatically-generated code that refers to it.  Deleting
    the code for an event handler would therefore lead to a syntax
    error.  Instead, the proper way to remove an event handler is to
    go to the list of events, right-click on the name of the event,
    and select "Reset" from the resulting popup menu.  This safely
    deletes the code and all automatically-generated references to
    it.  (Sometimes it doesn't delete the code, but if not, it is now
    safe to delete it.)
