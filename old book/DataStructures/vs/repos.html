<h1>Git Repositories</h1>

    In CIS 300, start code for each assignment will be distributed via
    a Git repository. Git is a <i>source control</i> system integrated
    into Visual Studio 2017.  Source control systems are powerful
    mechanisms for teams of programmers and other collaborators to
    manage multiple copies of various source files and other documents
    that all collaborators may be modifying.  While CIS 300 does not
    involve teamwork, source control provides a convenient mechanism
    for distribution of code and submission of assignment solutions.
    In addition, as we will discuss later in this chapter, source
    control provides mechanisms for accessing your code on multiple
    machines and for "checkpointing" your code.
    <p>
      At the heart of Git is the concept of a Git repository.  A Git
      repository is simply a folder on your local machine.  As you
      make changes within this folder, Git tracks these changes.  From
      time to time, you will <i>commit</i> these changes.  If you see
      that you have gone down a wrong path, you can <i>revert</i> to
      an earlier commit.
    </p>
    Git repositories may be hosted on a server such as <a href="github.com">GitHub</a>.  Various users may have copies of a
    Git repository on their own local machines.  Git provides tools
    for synchronizing local repositories with the repository hosted on
    the server in a consistent way.
    <p>
      For each lab and homework assignment in CIS 300, you will be
      provided a URL that will create your own private Git repository
      on GitHub.  The only people who will have access to your GitHub
      repositories are you, the CIS 300 instructors, and the CIS 300
      lab assistants.  These repositories will initially contain start
      code and perhaps data files for the respective assignments.  You
      will copy the repository to your local machine by <i>cloning</i>
      it.  When you are finished with the assignment, you will
      <i>push</i> the repository back to GitHub and submit its URL for
      grading.  In what follows, we will explain how to create and
      clone a GitHub repository.  Later in this chapter, we will
      explain how to commit changes, push a repository, and use some
      of the other features of Git.
    </p>
    Before you can access GitHub, you will need a GitHub account.  If
    you don't already have one, you can sign up for one at <a href="github.com">github.com</a>.  At some point after you have
    completed the sign-up process, GitHub will send you an email
    asking you to verify the email address you provided during the
    sign-up process.  After you have done this, you will be able to
    set up GitHub repositories.
    <p>
      For each assignment in CIS 300, you will be given an invitation
      URL, such as:
    </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/qSZ6_g_W">https://classroom.github.com/a/qSZ6_g_W</a></li>
</ul>
    Over the next few sections, we will be working through a simple
    example based on the above invitation link.  If you wish to work
    through this example, click on the above link.  You may be asked
    to sign in to GitHub, but once you are signed in, you will be
    shown a page asking you to accept the assignment.  Clicking the
    "Accept this assignment" button will create a GitHub repository
    for you.  You will be given a link that will take you to that
    repository.  From that page you will be able to view all of the
    files in the repository.
    <p>
      In order to be able to use this repository, you will need to
      clone it to your local machine.  To do this, first open Visual
      Studio 2017, then find the Team Explorer panel (if you don't see
      it, you can open it from the View menu).  In the Team Explorer,
      click on the icon that resembles an electrical plug at the top
      of the window.  Scroll down if necessary to "Local Git
      Repositories", and click on "Clone" at the top of that section.
      In your web browser, navigate to the GitHub repository that you
      wish to clone, and click on the "Clone or
      download" button.  This will display a URL - click on the button
      to its right to copy this URL to your clipboard.  Then go back
      to Visual Studio and paste this URL into the Team Explorer in
      the text box labeled, "Enter the URL of a Git repo to clone
      &lt;Required&gt;".  In the text box below that, fill in a new
      folder you want to use for this repository on your machine, then
      click the "Clone" button.  This will copy the Git repository
      from GitHub into the folder you selected, and add it to the list
      of local Git repositories in the Team Explorer.  It may also
      open the Solution Explorer to show the contents of the
      repository.
    </p>
    The following sections give an overview of how to use Visual
    Studio to edit and debug an application, as well as how to use Git
    within Visual Studio to maintain the local Git repository and
    synchronize it with the GitHub repository.
