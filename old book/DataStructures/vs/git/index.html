Source control systems are powerful mechanisms for teams of
    programmers and other collaborators to manage multiple copies of
    various source files that all may be modifying.  CIS 300 does not
    involve teamwork, but we will be using source control
    as a mechanism for assignment submission.  There are several
    benefits to using the source control provided by Visual Studio:
<ul>
<li> It is easy to ensure that all required files have been
	submitted. </li>
<li> It is easy to "checkpoint"
	your programs - if at some point you discover you've gone down
	a wrong path and want to retrieve code that you have since
	modified, you can do this easily. </li>
<li> You can access your uploaded code from any machine with Visual
	Studio 2017 and internet access. </li>
<li> You will get an introduction to a technology that's indispensable
	for the professional programmer. </li>
</ul>
In this class, you will be using Git, one of the most popular source
    control systems.  You will use Git to upload
    your code to <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, a widely used
    repository for open-source software.  GitHub also supports private
    repositories, where you will be uploading your assignments - only
    you and the course instructor and assistants will have access to
    your repositories.  Model solutions and start code for the
    assignments will also be distributed via GitHub.
    <p>
      Git is a <i>distributed</i> source control system.  This means
      that everyone who uses a Git repository has a local copy of that
      repository.  
      If you use more than one machine, you can keep a 
      local copy of each repository on each machine.
    </p>
<p>
      You will have a Git repository for each of your assignments.  On
      your local machine, a Git repository is simply a folder.
      Whenever changes are made within that folder, Git tracks these
      changes.  As you develop your programs.  you will from time to
      time <i>commit</i> these changes.  If you see that you have gone
      down a wrong path, you can <i>revert</i> to an earlier commit.
      When you are ready to upload your repository, you will
      <i>push</i> all committed changes
      to GitHub.
</p>
    The remainder of this section describes how to set up and use
    source control.  The sections "<a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/source-control-setup">Setting
    up Source Control"</a> and "<a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/using-source-control">Submitting
    Assignments</a>" contain all you will need for submitting your
    assignments.  The next two sections describe additional features
    of Git that can help you to develop code on multiple machines and
    to checkpoint your code.
