<h1>Setting up Source Control</h1>

The only setup required for using Git with GitHub in this class is to
    sign up for a GitHub account.  To do this, first navigate to <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.  There, you
    will be presented with a sign-up form - fill in the three boxes and
    click the "Sign up for GitHub" button.  You will then be shown a
    "Welcome" page, which you can dismiss by clicking the "Continue"
    button at the bottom.  You will then be presented with a form
    requesting various information - provide any information you feel
    comfortable giving, or provide no information at all by clicking
    "skip this step".
    <p>
      Once you have completed the sign-up process, you will be taken
      to your home page for your GitHub account.  Here, you may
      optionally edit your profile to contain information such as your
      real name.  To get to your profile, find the two drop-down menus
      at the top right - one is labeled with a "+", and the other with
      a random design.  Click the one with a random design and select
      "Your profile".  Click the "Edit profile" button and edit your
      profile to contain whatever information you
      want to provide.  Finish editing by clicking the "Update
      profile" button.
    </p>
    At some point, GitHub will send an email to the address you used
    when signing up.  This email will ask you to verify your email
    address by clicking on the "Verify email address" link in that
    message.  After you have done this, you will be able to set up Git
    repositories, as described in the next section.
