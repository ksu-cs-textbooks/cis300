# Setting up Source Control

The only setup required for using Git with GitHub in this class is to
sign up for a GitHub account. To do this, first navigate to
[GitHub](http://github.com). There, you will be presented with a sign-up
form - fill in the three boxes and click the "Sign up for GitHub"
button. You will then be shown a "Welcome" page, which you can dismiss
by clicking the "Continue" button at the bottom. You will then be
presented with a form requesting various information - provide any
information you feel comfortable giving, or provide no information at
all by clicking "skip this step".

Once you have completed the sign-up process, you will be taken to your
home page for your GitHub account. Here, you may optionally edit your
profile to contain information such as your real name. To get to your
profile, find the two drop-down menus at the top right - one is labeled
with a "+", and the other with a random design. Click the one with a
random design and select "Your profile". Click the "Edit profile" button
and edit your profile to contain whatever information you want to
provide. Finish editing by clicking the "Update profile" button.

At some point, GitHub will send an email to the address you used when
signing up. This email will ask you to verify your email address by
clicking on the "Verify email address" link in that message. After you
have done this, you will be able to set up Git repositories, as
described in the next section.
