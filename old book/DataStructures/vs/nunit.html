    <h1>Unit Testing</h1>

    Some of the lab assignments in CIS 300 use a technique called
    <i>unit testing</i> for testing the correctness of your code.
    Unit testing is an automated technique for testing individual
    <b>public</b> methods and properties using a pre-defined set of
    test cases.  We will be using an open-source unit-testing
    framework called <a href="http://nunit.org/">NUnit</a>.
    <!-- Two -->
    <!-- Visual Studio® extensions provide access to NUnit.  Both of these -->
    <!-- extensions have been installed on the lab machines, but if you -->
    <!-- want to use NUnit on your own machine, you will need to install -->
    <!-- the following: -->
    <!-- <ul> -->
    <!--   <li> -->
    <!-- 	<a -->
    <!-- 	href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NUnitDevelopers.NUnit3TestAdapter"><b>NUnit -->
    <!-- 	3 Test Adapter</b></a> -->
    <!--   </li> -->
    <!--   <li> -->
    <!-- 	<a -->
    <!-- 	href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NUnitDevelopers.NUnitTemplatesforVisualStudio"><b>NUnit -->
    <!-- 	VS Templates</b></a> -->
    <!--   </li> -->
    <!-- </ul> -->
    <!-- To install these extensions, follow links above and -->
    <!-- click the "Download" button.  Then make sure you are not currently -->
    <!-- running Visual Studio, and run the downloaded file. -->
    <p>
      An NUnit test suite is a separate project contained within the
      same solution as the project it is to test.  The GitHub
      repositories for lab assignments that utilize unit testing will
      initially contain these projects, whose names will typically end
      with ".Tests".  You should not modify these test projects.
    </p>
    A test project will contain one or more classes having the
    attribute, <b>[TestFixture]</b>.  These classes will contain the
    specific tests, each of which is a method with the attribute,
    <b>[Test]</b>.  The name of the method will briefly describe the
    test, and a more detailed explanation will be provided in comments.
    <p>
      To run all of the tests, first open the Test Explorer by going
      to the "Test" menu and selecting "Windows-&gt;Test Explorer".
      Then click "Run All" at the top of this window.  This will
      produce an output something like the following:
    </p>
    <p><img src="test-explorer.jpg"
	alt="A picture of the Test Explorer should appear here.">
    </p>
    The above output shows that there were two tests in the test
    suite.  The names of the tests are simply the names of the methods
    comprising the tests.  The output further shows that one of the
    tests, <b>LengthIsCorrect</b>, failed, whereas the other test,
    <b>FirstElementIs2</b>, passed.
    <p>
      The goal, of course, is to get all the tests to pass.  When a
      test fails, you will first want to refer to the comments on the
      test method in order to understand what it is testing.  Then by
      clicking on the failed test in the Test Explorer, you can see
      exactly what failed in the test - this will appear at the bottom
      of the window.  In some cases, an unexpected result will have
      been produced.  In such cases, the message will show what result
      was expected, and what it actually was.  In other cases, an
      exception will have been thrown.  In such cases, the exception
      will be displayed.  A stack trace will also be displayed, so
      that you can tell what line of code threw the exception - simply
      hover over the first line in the stack trace, and the file and
      line number will be displayed.  Finally, you can run the 
      debugger on the test itself by clicking on the test to
      highlight it in the Test Explorer, then right-clicking and
      selecting "Debug Selected Tests".  This will allow you to debug
      your code using the techniques describe in the section, "<a
      href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/debugger">The
      Debugger"</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Two potential errors deserve special mention.  Sometimes, the
      unit testing doesn't finish.  This usually indicates that one of
      the tests encountered an infinite loop.  The test hung in the
      loop will be shown in the Test Explorer with a green circle
      containing a white triangle - click this test to select it.
      Then stop the test by clicking the Cancel button near the top of
      the Test Explorer.  You can then run the debugger on this test
      as described above.  Clicking the blue "Pause" button while the
      debugger is running will pause the execution, helping you to
      determine where the infinite loop is.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other potential error we need to discuss is an exception
      that cannot be caught by a <b>try-catch</b> block.  By far the
      most common of these exceptions is the
      <b>StackOverflowException</b>.  When this exception is thrown
      during unit testing, one of the following will occur:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Some or all of the tests are not run, and the Output window
    contains the message, "The active test run was aborted. Reason:
	Process is terminated due to StackOverflowException."
      </li>
      <li>
	Alternatively, the following dialog may be displayed:
	<br>
	<img src="testhost.x86-has-stopped-working.JPG"
	  alt="Picture of an error dialog">
	<br>
	You can simply close this dialog by clicking the "X" in the
	upper right-hand corner.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, when this error occurs, it's more difficult to
      determine which test caused the exception.  You can run the
      debugger on each test individually to see if it throws a
      <b>StackOverflowException</b>.  In many cases, however, it is
      easier to examine each recursive call to make sure the call is made
      on a smaller problem instance.
    </p>
    
    When you believe you have fixed any errors in your code, you will
    usually want to run all the tests again, as fixing one error can
    sometimes introduce another.  However, there are times, such as
    when some of the tests are slow, when you don't want to run all
    the tests.  In such cases, you can select an appropriate
    alternative from the "Run..." drop-down at the top of the Test
    Explorer.  A useful option from this menu is "Run Failed Tests".
    Alternatively, you can select one or more tests from the Test
    Explorer (use Ctrl-Click to select multiple tests), then
    right-click and select "Run Selected Tests".
    <p>
      Whenever you run fewer than all the tests, the tests that were
      not run are dimmed in the Test Explorer to indicate that
      these results are on an older version of the code.  Be sure you
      always finish by running all the tests to make sure they all
      pass on the same version of your code.
    </p>
    Though it is not required for CIS 300, you might wish to
    experiment with unit testing on your homework assignments.  In
    what follows, we will briefly introduce the construction of your
    own unit-test suites.  We make no attempt here to be comprehensive
    - for more information, refer to the <a
    href="https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki">NUnit Documentation
      Wiki</a>.
    <p>
      If you are using your own machine, you will first need to
	install the Visual Studio extension 
    	<a
    	href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NUnitDevelopers.NUnitTemplatesforVisualStudio"><b>NUnit
	  VS Templates</b></a>.
    To install this extension, follow the link above and
    click the "Download" button.  Then make sure you are not currently
      running Visual Studio, and run the downloaded file.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To create a test
	project within a solution, go to the Solution Explorer,
	right-click on the solution (i.e., the top line), and select
	"Add-&gt;New Project...".  In the panel on the left, under
	"Visual C#", select "Test".  Then in the large panel on the
	right, select "NUnit 3 Unit Test Project".  At the bottom,
	select an appropriate name for the project, and click "OK".
	This will create a test project containing the class file,
	<b>TestClass.cs</b>, which you may rename if you wish.  This
	class is initialized with a trivial test method, which you may
      either remove or edit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to be able to use the NUnit 3 assertions, you will need
      to add a NuGet package to this test project.  In the Solution
      Explorer, right-click on the test project name, and select
      "Manage NuGet Packages...".  Then click the "Browse" tab at the
      top, and in the Search box, enter "NUnit3".  "NUnit3TestAdapter"
      should appear in the resulting list.  Click this item, and click
      the "Install" button to the right.
    </p>
    
In order to allow your test project to access the project it is to
    test, you will need to add to your test project a reference to the
    project it will test.  First, however, you need to correct a
    problem with the way Visual Studio creates the test project.  In
    the Solution Explorer, double-click on "Properties" within the
    project you wish to 
	test.  Take note of the .NET Framework version that appears under
	"Target framework:".   Now return to the Solution Explorer,
    and double-click "Properties" with your test project.  Under
    "Target framework:", change the version to match the version for
    the project you wish to test, and click "Yes" in the resulting
    dialog.   Return once more to the Solution Explorer,
    right-click on the test project name, and select
    "Add-&gt;Reference...".  In the resulting dialog, click on
    "Projects" on the left, click the check box next to the project
    you wish to test, and click "OK".
    <p>
      You are now ready to begin writing your tests.  Each test should
      be a single method having the <b>[Test]</b> attribute and an
      empty parameter list.  Each method will need to contain code to
      set up and conduct a single test for the code in your project.
      Once you have collected all the output from the test, you will
      need to check its correctness.  Within NUnit 3, this is
      typically done with the <b>static</b> method
      <b>Assert.That</b>.  There are several overloads for this
      method, but the one we will discuss takes two parameters.  The
      first is the output that you wish to check - it may be of any
      type.  The second is a <i>constraint</i> that specifies a
      condition that the first parameter must satisfy in order to be
      correct.
    </p>
    Constraints are typically generated using one of the <b>static</b>
    classes <b>Is</b> or <b>Has</b>.  For example, the <b>Is</b> class
    has a method <b>EqualTo</b> that takes an <b>object</b> as its
    only parameter, and returns a constraint that specifies equality
    to the given object.  Thus, we can assert that the <b>int</b>
    variable <tt>n</tt> has a value of 10 with the following
    statement:
<pre>
Assert.That(n, Is.EqualTo(10));
</pre>
    Each constraint contains the properties <b>And</b> and <b>Or</b>,
    which can be used to combine constraints logically.  For example,
    we can assert that 0 &le; n &le; 10 as follows:
<pre>
Assert.That(n, Is.GreaterThanOrEqualTo(0).And.LessThanOrEqualTo(10));
</pre>
    There is also a property <b>Not</b>, both in the <b>Is</b> class
    and in the objects returned by the <b>And</b> and <b>Or</b>
    properties.  For example:
<pre>
Assert.That(n, Is.Not.InRange(0, 10).And.Not.InRange(100, 200));
</pre>
    All of the constraints available are documented at <a
      href="https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Constraints">https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Constraints</a>.
      The constraints on that page are listed by their names; however,
      the names themselves are rarely used in writing assertions in
      test code.  Because the names are descriptive, it is usually
      easy to find the one you want.  Once you have found it, click on
      the link for documentation on how to use it.  Pay attention to
      how it is used with <b>Is</b> or <b>Has</b>.  It is usually not
    hard to express the assertion you need.
    <p>
      When writing tests, it is possible to include multiple
      assertions within the same method.  If one of the assertions
      fails, none of the subsequent assertions is checked.  It is
      usually best, however, to include only one assertion within each
      method.
