<h1>Class Libraries</h1>

Besides Windows Forms Applications, the other type of Visual Studio
    project that we will be building in CIS 300 is a Class Library.
    A Class Library is not a stand-alone application, but rather a
    collection of code that can be used by various applications.  The
    .NET Framework is a collection of class libraries.  When we
    implement a data structure, we often want to place it in a class
    library so that it is available to a variety of applications.
    <p>
      While it is possible to create a solution containing a single
      project that is a class library, in CIS 300, we will instead
      work with solutions containing both a Class Library project and
      a Windows Forms Application project that will use the class
      library.  We therefore need to know how to create a new class
      library project within an existing solution.
    </p>
    
    Suppose, for example, that we have a solution containing the
    program from the section, "<a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/stringbuilders"><b>StringBuilder</b>s</a>"
    (this solution may be obtained by creating Git repository using <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/lQSbxCEo">this URL</a>).  We
    wish to replace the implmentation of <b>StringBuilder</b> from the
    .NET Framework with the class defined in "<a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/stringbuilder-impl">Implementation
    of <b>StringBuilder</b>s</a>".  Furthermore, we wish to place this
    class in a new class library.  To create a new Class Library
    project within this solution, right-click on the solution name in
    the Solution Explorer (i.e., on the top line), and select "Add
    -&gt; New Project...".  From the resulting dialog, select "Class
    Library" (<i>not</i> one of the portable versions), and name it
    <tt>Ksu.Cis300.StringBuilderLibrary</tt>.  For the location, use
    the folder containing the Git repository that includes the Visual
    Studio solution, so that this project will be included in the same
    Git repository.  When the project is created, a code window
    containing a template for a <b>public class</b> definition will
    appear.  There will be no Design window, as you are not building a
    graphical application (although graphical controls can be built
    within a class library).  The names of the source file and the
    class should now be changed to <b>StringBuilder</b> using the
    Solution Explorer in the same way as for a Windows Forms
    Application.  Code for the <b>StringBuilder</b> class can now be
    copied either from the section, "<a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/stringbuilder-impl">Implementation
    of <b>StringBuilder</b>s</a>" or the Git repository created using
    <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/C2R3XPjX">this URL</a>.
    Although we don't need them for this example, additional class
    files can be added to the project by going to the Solution
    Explorer, right-clicking on the project name (not the solution
    name), and selecting "AddÃ¢â‚¬â€˜&gt;Class...".
    
<p></p>
Just having this project in the same solution isn't enough to allow it
    to access the class library.  In order to enable this access, we
    need to go back to the Solution Explorer, right-click on the
    project we just added, and select,
    "AddÃ‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€˜&gt;Ã‚Â Reference...".  In the resulting
    dialog, we open the "Project" group on the left and select
    "Solution" from that group, then click the
    box next to "Ksu.Cis300.StringBuilderLibrary" in the main panel,
    and click the "OK" button at the lower right.  Once this is done,
    we can edit "UserInterface.cs" in the
    <b>Ksu.Cis300.StringsAndStringBuilders</b> project we just added, and
    change
<pre>
using System.Text;
</pre>
to
<pre>
using Ksu.Cis300.StringBuilderLibrary;
</pre>
Then wherever the class <b>StringBuilder</b> occurs in this file, the
    implementation in our class library will be used.
