    <h1>Checkpointing</h1>

    Sometimes when writing code, we see that we have gone down a wrong
    path and would like to undo some major changes we have made.
    Source control can help us with this if we <i>checkpoint</i> by
    committing our changes from time to time, using commit messages
    that clearly describe the changes made in that commit.  (Note that
    it is not necessary to push these commits to GitHub until you are
    ready to submit the assignment.)  Git's
    <i>revert</i> feature allows us to undo any of these commits.
    <p>
      To access Git's revert feature, open the Visual
      Studio Team Explorer, click on the icon that looks like a house
      at the top, and click on "Changes".  Within the resulting
      "Changes" window, click on "Actions", and select "View
      History..." from the resulting drop-down list.  This will reveal
      a list of all the commits for this local Git repository, with
      the most recent commit listed at the top.  To undo all of the
      changes in any commit, right-click on that commit, and select
      "Revert" from the popup menu.  The result is automatically
      committed. 
    </p>
    Note that reverting a commit only undoes changes made within that
    commit.  If code changed in that commit was changed again later,
    this may result in a conflict that will need to be resolved as
    described in <a
    href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/multiple-machines">the
      previous section</a>.
    <p>
      Sometimes what you really want to do is to roll your code back
      to a previous state.  If you have any uncommitted changes, you
      will first want to discard them by going to the "Changes" window
      as described above, right-clicking on the top folder in the
      "Changes" section, and selecting "Undo Changes..." from the
      resulting popup menu.  You will then be given a confirmation
      dialog.  Once you have discarded these changes, you can revert
      commits starting with the most recent, and working back to the
      point you want.  Note that because each revert is also a commit,
      you can later revert a reverted commit if necessary.
    </p>
    It is also possible to undo changes to a specific file, rather
    than in the entire solution.  You can obtain a history of the
    commits on a specific file by going to the Solution Explorer,
    right-clicking on that file, and selecting "View History..." from
    the resulting popup menu.  You can then revert any of these
    commits as above.  You can also discard uncommitted changes to a
    single file by right-clicking on that file in the "Changes" list
    and selecting "Undo Changes..." from the resulting popup menu.  Be
    careful, however, about undoing or discarding changes on a
    ".Designer.cs" file, as usually when you make changes in the
    designer, changes are also made to the file, Resources.resx.
