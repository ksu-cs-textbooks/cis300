<h1>Visual Studio Solutions</h1>

All code developed within Visual Studio 2019 must belong to one or more
    <i>solutions</i>.  When you are using Visual Studio to develop a
    program, you will be working with a single solution.  A solution
    will contain one or more <i>projects</i>.  Each of these projects
    may belong to more than one solution.  Each project typically
    contains several files, including source code files.  Each file will
    typically belong to only one project.  The following figure
    illustrates some of the possible relationships between solutions,
    projects, and files.
<p>
<img alt="Relationships between solutions, projects, and files" src="solutions.jpg"/>
</p>
Note that in the above figure, Project4 is contained in both Solution2
    and Solution3.
In this section, we will
    focus on solutions that contain exactly one project, which in turn
    belongs to no other solutions (e.g., Solution1 in the above figure).
    
<p>
Whenever you clone a Git repository using Visual Studio 2019 (see <a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/version-control">the
	previous section</a>), the Visual Studio Solution Explorer
	will display the contents of the repository.  In CIS 300, each
	repository will contain exactly one solution, whose name will
	have the suffix, ".sln".  To open this solution, double-click
	on it.  The Solution Explorer will now give you a view of the
	structure of your solution; for example, opening the solution
	in the repository given in the previous section will result in
	the following being shown in the Solution Explorer:
</p>
<img alt="A picture of a Solution Explorer should appear here" src="solution-explorer.jpg"/>
<p>
Near the top, just under the search box, is the name of the solution
      with an indication of how many projects it contains.  Listed
      under the name of the solution is each project, together with
      the various components of the project.  One of the projects is
      always shown in bold face.  The bold face indicates that this
      project is the startup project; i.e., it is the project that the
      debugger will attempt to execute whenever it is invoked (for
      more details, see the section, "<a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/debugger">The
      Debugger</a>").  
</p>
The project components having a suffix of ".cs" are C# source code
    files.  When a Windows Forms Application is created, its project
    will contain the following three source code files:
<ul>
<li> <b>Form1.cs:</b> This file contains code that you will write in
	order to implement the main GUI for the application.  It will
	be discussed in more detail in "<a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/code-window">The Code
	Window</a>". </li>
<li> <b>Form1.Designer.cs:</b> You will need to click the triangle to
	the left of "Form1.cs" in the Solution Explorer in order to
	reveal this file name.  This 
	contains automatically-generated code that completes the
	definition of the main GUI.  You will build this code
	indirectly by laying out the graphical components of GUI in
	the design window (see the section, "<a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/design-window">The
	Design Window</a>" for more details).  Ordinarily, you will
	not need to look at the contents of this file. </li>
<li> <b>Program.cs:</b>  This file will contain something like the
	following:
<pre>
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace Ksu.Cis300.HelloWorld
{
    static class Program
    {
        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        /// The main entry point for the application.
        /// &lt;/summary&gt;
        [STAThread]
        static void Main()
        {
            Application.EnableVisualStyles();
            Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
            Application.Run(new Form1());
        }
    }
}
</pre>
The <b>Main</b> method is where the application code begins.  The last
	line of this method constructs a new instance of the class
	that implements the GUI.  The call to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms157902(v=vs.110).aspx"><b>Application.Run</b></a>
	displays the GUI and starts a loop that processes events such
	as mouse clicks and keystrokes.  Ordinarily, there is no need
	to look at this code. </li>
</ul>
One of the first things you will need to do when starting a new
    Windows Forms Application is to change the name of Form1.cs, as
    this name (without the ".cs" suffix) is also the name of the class
    implementing the GUI.  Therefore, it will need to be changed in
    order to conform to the <a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/naming">naming
    convention</a> for classes.  To do this, right-click on its name
    in the Solution Explorer, and select "Rename" from the resulting
    popup menu.  You will then be able to edit the name in the
    Solution Explorer.  When you have entered the new name, the
    following window will be displayed:
<p>
<img alt="A picture of a window should appear here." src="rename-prompt.jpg"/>
</p>
You should click the "Yes" button in order to make the renaming
    consistent - particularly to rename the class as well.
