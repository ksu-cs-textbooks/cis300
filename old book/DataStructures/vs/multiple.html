<h1>Using Multiple Machines</h1>

    Source control provides one way to access your code from multiple
    machines.  Before you decide to do this, however, you should
    consider whether this is the best approach.  For example, if you
    have a <a href="https://selfserv.cs.ksu.edu/">CS Account</a>, you
    have a network file system (the U: drive on CS Windows systems)
    that you can use whenever you have internet access.  From off
    campus, you need to tunnel into campus using a Virtual Private
    Network, or VPN (see <a href="http://www.k-state.edu/its/security/vpn/">the KSU
    Information Technology Services  page on Virtual Private
    Networking</a> for instructions).  Once on campus, you can mount
    this file system as a network drive by following the instructions
    on the CS support page, "<a href="https://support.cs.ksu.edu/CISDocs/wiki/Disk_Usage">Disk
      Usage</a>".
    <p>
      As an alternative to the U: drive or some cloud service, you can
      use your GitHub repositories to store a master copy of each
      assignment, and clone local copies as needed on the different
      machines you use.  Once you have code in a GitHub repository,
      you can clone that repository to a local machine as described in
      "<a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/version-control">Git
      Repositories</a>".  When you are finished working on that 
      machine, commit all changes and push them to GitHub.  If at some
      later point you need to resume working on a machine whose Git
      repository is out of date, you can update it as follows:
    </p>
<ol>
<li>
	Open the Visual Studio Team Explorer.
      </li>
<li>
	Click the icon that looks like a house at the top.
      </li>
<li>
	Click the "Sync" button.
      </li>
<li>
	In the "Incoming Commits" section, click "Pull".
      </li>
</ol>

    If you are careful about pushing all changes to GitHub and
    updating each local copy whenever you begin working on it,
    everything should go smoothly.  Problems can occur, however, if
    you have made changes to a local version that is out of date,
    then either try to update it by pulling the GitHub copy, or try to
    push these changes to GitHub.  In such
    cases, there may be conflicts between the two versions.  Git will
    try to resolve these conflicts, but in many cases it will need help
    from you in determining how to merge the conflicting changes.
    <p>
      If Git needs help in resolving conflicts, the Team Explorer will
      show a "Resolve Conflicts" page listing the files containing the
      conflicts.  Clicking on a file will show two versions of the
      file - one obtained by applying the changes made on the the
      local copy, and one obtained by applying the changes recorded
      with the GitHub copy.  You may select one of these versions by
      clicking either "Take Source" or "Keep Target" at the bottom, or
      you may click the "Merge" button to select changes individually
      from each version.  If you click the "Merge" button, checkboxes
      will appear next to each change in each version.  Check the
      boxes next to the changes you want to keep.  As you do this, the
      changes you select will be reflected in the version shown below
      the two original versions.  You may also edit this result
      directly.  When you are finished, click the "Accept Merge"
      button at the top.
