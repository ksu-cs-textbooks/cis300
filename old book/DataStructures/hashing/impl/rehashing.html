<h1>Rehashing</h1>

In this section, we will show how to improve the performance of a hash
    table by adjusting the size of the array.  In order to see how the
    array size impacts the performance, let's suppose we are using an
    array with <i>m</i> locations, and that we are storing <i>n</i>
    keys in the hash table.  In what follows, we will analyze the
    number of keys we will need to examine while searching for a
    particular key, <i>k</i>.
<p>
In the worst case, no matter how large the array is, it is possible
      that all of the keys map to the same 
      array location, and therefore all end up in one long linked
      list.  In such a case, we will need to examine all of 
      the keys whenever we are looking for the last one 
      in this list.  However, the 
      worst case is too pessimistic - if the hash function is
      implemented properly, it is reasonable to expect that something
      approaching a uniform random distribution will occur.  We will
      therefore consider the number of keys we would expect to
      examine, assuming a uniform random distribution of keys
      throughout the table.
</p>
We'll first consider the case in which <i>k</i> is not in the hash
    table.  In this case, we will need to examine all of the keys in
    the linked list at the array location where <i>k</i> belongs.
    Because each 
    of the <i>n</i> keys is equally likely to map to each of the
    <i>m</i> array locations, we would expect, on average,
    <i>n</i> / <i>m</i> keys to be mapped to the location
    where <i>k</i> belongs.  Hence, in this case, we would expect to
    examine <i>n</i> / <i>m</i> keys, on average.
<p>
Now let's consider the case in which <i>k</i> is in the hash table.
      In this case, we will examine the key <i>k</i>, plus all the
      keys that precede <i>k</i> in its linked list.  The number of
      keys preceding <i>k</i> cannot be more than the total number of
      keys other than <i>k</i> in that linked list.  Again, because
      each of the <i>n</i> - 1 keys other than <i>k</i> is
      equally likely to map to each of the <i>m</i> array locations,
      we would expect, on average,
      (<i>n</i> - 1) / <i>m</i> keys other than
      <i>k</i> to be in the same linked list as <i>k</i>.  Thus, we
      can expect, on average, to examine no more than 1 + 
      (<i>n</i> - 1) / <i>m</i> keys when looking
      for a key that is present.
</p>
Notice that both of the values derived above decrease as <i>m</i>
    increases.  Specifically, if <i>m</i> Ã¢â€°Â¥ <i>n</i>, the
    expected number of examined keys on a failed lookup is no more
    than 1, and the expected number of examined keys on a successful
    lookup is less than 2.  We can therefore expect to achieve very
    good performance if we keep the number of array locations at least
    as large as the number of keys.
<p>
We have already seen (e.g., in "<a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/stringbuilder-impl">Implementation
	of <b>StringBuilder</b>s</a>") how we can keep an array large
	enough by doubling its size whenever we need to.  However, a
	hash table presents two unique challenges for this technique.
	First, as we observed in <a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/simple-hash-table-impl">the
	previous section</a>, we are most likely to get good
	performance from a hash table if the number of array locations
	is a prime number.  However, doubling a prime number will
	never give us a prime number.  The other challenge is due to
	the fact that when we change the size of the array, we
	consequently change the hash function, as the hash function
	uses the array size.  As a result, the keys will need to go to
	different array locations in the new array.
</p>
In order to tackle the first challenge, recall that we presented an
    algorithm for finding all prime numbers less than a given <i>n</i>
    in "<a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/sieve-eratosthenes">Finding
    Prime Numbers</a>"; however, this is a rather expensive way to
    find a prime number of an appropriate size.  While there are more
    efficient algorithms, we really don't need one.  Suppose we start
    with an array size of 5 (there may be applications using many
    small hash tables - the .NET implementation starts with an array
    size of 3).  5 is larger than
    2<sup>2</sup> = 4.  If we double this value 28 times,
    we reach a value larger than 2<sup>30</sup>, which is larger than
    1 billion.  More importantly, this value is large enough that we
    can't double it again, as an array in C# must contain fewer than
    2<sup>31</sup> locations.  Hence, we need no more than 29
    different array sizes.  We can pre-compute these and hard-code
    them into our implementation; for example,
<pre>
private int[] _tableSizes = 
{
    5, 11, 23, 47, 97, 197, 397, 797, 1597, 3203, 6421, 12853, 25717,
    51437, 102877, 205759, 411527, 823117, 1646237, 3292489, 6584983,
    13169977, 26339969, 52679969, 105359939, 210719881, 421439783,
    842879579, 1685759167 
}; 
</pre>
Each of the values in the above array is a prime number, and each one
    after the first is slightly more than twice its predecessor.  In
    order to make use of these values, we need a <b>private</b> field
    to store the index at which the current table size is stored in
    this array.  We also need to keep track of
    the number of keys currently stored.  As this information is
    useful to the user, a <b>public int Count</b> property would be
    appropriate.  It can use the default implementation with a
    <b>get</b> accessor and a <b>private set</b> accessor.
<p>
One important difference between the reason for rehashing and the
      reason for creating a larger array for an implementation of a <a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/stringbuilder-impl"><b>StringBuilder</b></a>,
      <a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/stack-impl">stack</a>,
      or <a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/queue-impl">queue</a> is
      that rehashing is done simply for performance reasons - there is
      always room to put a new key and value into a hash table unless
      we have run out of memory.  For this reason, it makes sense to
      handle rehashing <i>after</i> we have added the new key and
      value.  This results in one extra linked-list insertion (i.e.,
      updating two references) each time we rehash, but it simplifies
      the coding somewhat.  Because rehashing is rarely done, this
      overhead is minimal, and seems to be a reasonable price to pay
      for simpler code.
</p>
Once a new key and value have been added, we first need to update the
    <b>Count</b>.  We then need to check to see whether
    this number exceeds the current array size.  As we do this, we
    should also make sure that the array size we are using is not the
    last array size in <tt>_tableSizes</tt>, because if it is, we
    can't rehash.  If both of these conditions hold, we need to
    rehash.
<p>
To begin rehashing, we copy the reference to the table into a local
      variable and increment the field giving our current index into
      <tt>_tableSizes</tt>.  We then construct for the table field a
      new array whose size is given by the value at the new current
      index into <tt>_tableSizes</tt>.  Note that it is important that
      the local variable is used to refer to the old table, and that
      the field is used to refer to the new table, as the hash
      function uses the field to obtain the array size.
</p>
We then need to move all keys and values from the old table to the new
    one.  As we do this, we will need to recompute the hash function
    for each key, as the hash function has now changed.  We therefore
    need two nested loops.  The outer loop iterates through the
    locations in the old table, and the inner loop iterates as long as
    the linked list at the current table location is non-empty.  On
    each iteration of the inner loop:
<ul>
<li> Use a local variable to save a reference to the first cell in the
	linked list at the current table location. </li>
<li> Remove this cell from this linked list. </li>
<li> Using the hash function, compute the new array location of the
	key in this cell. </li>
<li> Insert this cell into the beginning of the linked list at the new
	array location in the new table.</li>
</ul>
