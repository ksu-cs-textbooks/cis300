<h1>Hash Codes</h1>

Whenever equality is redefined for a type, the hash code computation
    for that type needs to be redefined in a consistent way.  This is
    done by  <a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/method-overriding">overriding</a>
	that type's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object.gethashcode.aspx"><b>GetHashCode</b></a>
    method.  In order for hashing to be implemented correctly and 
    efficiently, this method should satisfy the following goals:
<ul>
<li> Equal keys must have the same hash code.  This is necessary in
	order for the <b>Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</b> class
	to be able to find a given key that it has stored.  On the
	other hand, because the number of possible keys is usually
	larger than the number of possible hash codes, unequal keys
	are also allowed to have the same hash code. </li> <li> The
	computation should be done quickly. </li> <li> Hash codes
	should be uniformly distributed even if the keys are
	not. </li>
</ul>
The last goal above may seem rather daunting, particularly in light of
    our desire for a quick computation.  In fact, it is impossible to
    guarantee in general - provided there are more than
    2<sup>32</sup>(<i>k</i> - 1) possible keys from which to
    choose, no matter how the hash code computation is implemented, we
    can always find at least <i>k</i> keys with the same hash code.
    However, this is a problem that has been studied a great deal, and
    several techniques have been developed that are effective in
    practice.  We will caution, however, that not every technique that
    looks like it should be effective actually is in practice.  It is
    best to use techniques that have been demonstrated to be effective
    in a wide variety of applications.  We will examine one of these
    techniques in what follows.
<p>
A guiding principle in developing hashing techniques is to use all
      information available in the key.  By using all the information,
      we will be sure to use the information that distinguishes this
      key from other keys.  This information includes not just the
      values of the individual parts of the the key, but also the
      order in which they occur, provided this order is significant in
      distinguishing unequal keys.  For example, the strings, "being"
      and "begin" contain the same letters, but are different because
      the letters occur in a different order.
</p>
One specific technique initializes the hash code to 0, then processes
    the key one component at a time.  These components may be bytes,
    characters, or other parts no larger than 32 bits each.  For
    example, for the Nim board positions discussed in "<a href="/~rhowell/DataStructures/redirect/memoization">Memoization</a>",
    the components would be the number of stones on each pile, the
    limit for each pile, and the total number of piles (to distinguish
    between a board ending with empty piles and a board with fewer
    piles).  For each
    component, it does the following:
<ul>
<li> Multiply the hash code by some fixed odd integer. </li>
<li> Add the current component to the hash code. </li>
</ul>
<a name="checked-unchecked"></a>
Due to the repeated multiplications, the above computation will often
    overflow an <b>int</b>.  This is not a problem - in fact, we want
    to be sure that this overflow is allowed to happen without
    throwing an exception.  By default, whether an exception is thrown
    in this situation depends upon certain settings in the execution
    environment.  However, we can override these settings to avoid
    throwing an exception by enclosing the code within an
    <b>unchecked</b> construct:
<pre>
unchecked
{
    // Code in which we want to allow integer overflow to occur.
}
</pre>
Likewise, if we want to ensure that an exception is thrown if overflow
    occurs, we can enclose code within a <b>checked</b> construct.
<p></p>
In order to understand this computation a little better, let's first
    ignore the effect of this overflow.  We'll denote the fixed odd
    integer by <i>x</i>, and the components of the key as
    <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>, . . ., <i>k<sub>n</sub></i>.
    Then this is the result of the computation:
<p>
( . . . ((0x + <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>)<i>x</i> + <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>) . . . )<i>x</i> + <i>k<sub>n</sub></i> = <i>k</i><sub>1</sub><i>x</i><sup><i>n</i>-1</sup> + <i>k</i><sub>2</sub><i>x</i><sup><i>n</i>-2</sup> + . . . + <i>k<sub>n</sub></i>.
</p>
Because the above is a polynomial, this hashing scheme is called
    <i>polynomial hashing</i>.  While the computation itself is
    efficient, performing just a couple of arithmetic operations on
    each component, the result is to multiply each component by a
    unique value (<i>x<sup>i</sup></i> for some <i>i</i>) depending on
    its position within the key.
<p>
Now let's consider the effect of overflow on the above polynomial.
      What this does is to keep only the low-order 32 bits of the
      value of the polynomial.  Looking at it another way, we end up
      multiplying <i>k<sub>i</sub></i> by only the low-order 32 bits
      of <i>x</i><sup><i>n</i>-<i>i</i></sup>.  This helps to explain
      why <i>x</i> is an odd number - raising an even number to the
      <i>i</i>th power forms a number ending in <i>i</i> 0s in binary.
      Thus, if there are more than 32 components in the key, all but
      the last 32 will be multiplied by 0, and hence, ignored.
</p>
There are other potential problems with using certain odd numbers for
    <i>x</i>.  For example, we wouldn't want to use 1, because that
    would result in simply adding all the components together, and we
    would lose any information regarding their positions within the
    key.  Using -1 would be almost as bad, as we would multiply all
    components in odd positions by -1 and all components in even
    positions by 1.  The effect of overflow can cause similar
    behavior; for example, if we place 2<sup>31</sup> - 1 in
    an <b>int</b> variable and square it, the overflow causes the
    result to be 1.  Successive powers will then alternate between
    2<sup>31</sup> - 1 and 1.
<p>
It turns out that this cyclic behavior occurs no matter what odd
      number we use for <i>x</i>.  However, in most cases the cycle is
      long enough that keys of a reasonable size will have each
      component multiplied by a unique value.  The only odd numbers
      that result in short cycles are those that are adjacent to a
      multiple of a large power of 2 (note that 0 is a multiple of any
      integer).
</p>
The other potential problem occurs when we are hashing fairly short
    keys.  In such cases, if <i>x</i> is also small enough, the values
    computed will all be much smaller than the maximum possible
    integer value (2<sup>31</sup> - 1).  As a result, we
    will not have a uniform distribution of values.  We therefore want
    to avoid making <i>x</i> too small.
<p>
Putting all this together, choosing <i>x</i> to be an odd number
      between 30 and 40 works pretty well.  These values are large
      enough so that 7 key components will usually overflow an
      <b>int</b>.  Furthermore, they all have a cycle length greater
      than 100 million.
</p>
We should always save the hash code in a <b>private</b> field after we
    compute it so that subsequent requests for the same hash code
    don't result in repeating the computation.  This can be done in
    either of two ways.  One way is to compute it in
    an <i>eager</i> fashion by doing it in the constructor.  When
    doing it this way, the <b>GetHashCode</b> method simply needs to
    return the value of the <b>private</b> field.  While this is often
    the easiest way, it sometimes results in computing a hash code
    that we end up not using.  The alternative is to compute it in a
    <i>lazy</i> fashion.  This requires an extra <b>private</b> field
    of type <b>bool</b>.  This field is used to indicate whether the
    hash code has been computed yet or not.  With this approach, the
    <b>GetHashCode</b> method first checks this field to see if the
    hash code has been computed.  If not, it computes the hash code
    and saves it in its field.  In either case, it then returns the
    value of the hash code field.
