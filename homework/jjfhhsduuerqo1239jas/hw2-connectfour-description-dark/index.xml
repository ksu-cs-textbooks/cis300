It is a two player game where each player takes turns in placing chips in a vertically standing board that has six rows and seven columns. The person who gets four of their chips in a row (diagonally, vertically, or horizontally) wins. This game can also be drawn. If the board fills up without either player getting four in a row or if there are no more moves left that enable a player to win, then that game is considered a draw. For the purposes of this assignment, you only need to worry about a draw when the board is full. You will be writing a program that lets two humans play against each other in a game of Connect Four.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/homework/jjfhhsduuerqo1239jas/hw2-connectfour-description-dark/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
