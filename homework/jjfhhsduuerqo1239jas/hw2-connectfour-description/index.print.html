It is a two player game where each player takes turns in placing chips in a vertically standing board that has six rows and seven columns. The person who gets four of their chips in a row (diagonally, vertically, or horizontally) wins. This game can also be drawn. If the board fills up without either player getting four in a row or if there are no more moves left that enable a player to win, then that game is considered a draw. For the purposes of this assignment, you only need to worry about a draw when the board is full. You will be writing a program that lets two humans play against each other in a game of Connect Four."><meta name=author content="Rod Howell and Josh Weese"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:description content="User Requirements This assignment will focus on the game called Connect Four, also referred to as four in a row or four in a line.
