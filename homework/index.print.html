<h2 id="user-requirements">User Requirements</h2>
<p>This assignment will focus on the game called Connect Four, also referred to as four in a row or four in a line.  It is a two player game where each player takes turns in placing chips in a vertically standing board that has <strong>six</strong> rows and <strong>seven</strong> columns. The person who gets four of their chips in a row (diagonally, vertically, or horizontally) wins.  This game can also be drawn.  If the board fills up without either player getting four in a row or if there are no more moves left that enable a player to win, then that game is considered a draw.  For the purposes of this assignment, you only need to worry about a draw when the board is full.  You will be writing a program that lets two humans play against each other in a game of Connect Four.</p>

<h2 id="starting-the-assignment">Starting the Assignment</h2>
<p>Begin by creating a GitHub repository using <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/OfTD0kxQ" target="_blank"><strong>this URL</strong> </a>
, and clone it to your local machine. This repository contains a new Windows Forms Application and test cases.</p>
<h2 id="user-interface">User Interface</h2>
<p>The initial user interface of the game is quite bare.  Before the program executes, the interface should look like this:</p>
<p>
<a href="#image-69c869b0ea0dc63d875d83b63338aef9" class="lightbox-link">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis300/homework/jjfhhsduuerqo1239jas/hw2-connectfour-description/uxInitial.png" alt="uxInitial" style="height: auto; width: auto;" loading="lazy">

</a></p>
<p>You can see that it is quite empty.  This is because most of the UI is going to be added dynamically at run time.  This image shows what you need to build in the Designer window in Visual Studio.  The rest will be added through code later.  The form should be locked from being able to be resized (set the <code>FormBorderStyle</code> property for the form to <em>FixedSingle</em>).  The overall form should be about 430 wide by 440 tall.  The initial interface has three **<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.flowlayoutpanel?view=net-5.0" target="_blank">FlowLayoutPanel</a>
**s  that will help organize our dynamic controls once they are loaded.</p>
<ul>
<li>The top <strong>FlowLayoutPanel</strong> has two <strong>Label</strong>s that keep track of the user&rsquo;s turn.  Note that to turn the background color of a <strong>Label</strong> to white, modify the <strong>BackColor</strong> property.  The <strong>FlowDirection</strong> property of this panel should be set to flow from right to left.</li>
<li>The second <strong>FlowLayoutPanel</strong> will contain all of the buttons that will place game pieces on the board.  The <strong>FlowDirection</strong> property of this panel should be set to flow from left to right.</li>
<li>The bottom <strong>FlowLayoutPanel</strong> will be used to contain all of the <strong>Label</strong>s that represent the slots on the Connect Four board. The <strong>FlowDirection</strong> property of this panel should be set to flow from top down.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final user interface once the game is loaded should look like the following:</p>
<p>

</a></p>
<p>Instructions for populating the UI at run time will be found below.</p>
<p>The interactions with the UI, overall, are quite simple.  Each of the place buttons above each column should be bound to the <code>uxPlaceButtonClick</code> method described later in this assignment.  This will cause a chip (<code>GamePiece</code>) to be placed in the last available slot.  This chip should be the same color as the Player.  After each click of a place button, the next player gets their turn.   The label in the top right hand corner of the UI indicates who&rsquo;s turn it is by using a label filled with the text and color of that player.  Once a player wins or the game is a draw, a message box should appear stating who won the game.  Once the user presses OK, the program should exit.</p>

<h2 id="doubly-linked-lists">Doubly Linked Lists</h2>
<p>We have done a lot of work with single linked lists thus far.  A major drawback of the single linked list data structure is that you can only traverse the structure in a single direction.  This doesn&rsquo;t make it very flexible.  To solve this problem, we can use a <strong>double</strong> <strong>linked list</strong>.  The cells that make up the linked list are very similar to the single linked list, but in addition to the pointer to the next cell in the list, it also contains a reference to the previous cell in the list like so:</p>
<p>

</a></p>
<h3 id="representing-the-board">Representing the Board</h3>
<p>The game board will be represented by using only double linked lists.  Each cell on the board is stored in a <strong>DoubleLinkedListCell&lt;GamePiece&gt;</strong> in each column. The occupied cells of a single column are linked together into a doubly linked list.  For each of these columns, you will have a <strong>DoubleLinkedListCell&lt;DoubleLinkedListCell&lt;GamePiece&gt;&gt;</strong> whose <strong>Data</strong> property contains the <strong>DoubleLinkedListCell&lt;GamePiece&gt;</strong> at the top of the column.   Below is an example of a game where the red player wins diagonally (last piece placed was in column D), along with what the game looks like as the double linked lists:</p>

<p>See that the cells in each row are <strong>not</strong> connected to the adjacent columns.  This means that in order to get to a particular cell, you will have to find the correct column first.  This is not the most efficient representation of the Connect Four game board; however, its designed as an exercise to test your ability to navigate through linked lists and work with references.</p>
<h2 id="code-requirements">Code Requirements</h2>
<p>Your program should be organized into the following classes.  Note that many things here are made public (not all) in order to improve accessibility for unit testing. It is important to name everything as listed since the provided unit tests will be expecting them as such.  You may add additional private methods to any of the classes that help you with your implementation.</p>
<h3 id="doublelinkedlistcell-class">DoubleLinkedListCell Class</h3>
<p>This is a <strong>generic</strong> class that represents a cell in a doubly linked list as described above in &ldquo;Doubly Linked Lists.&rdquo;  Note that the <strong>Id</strong> of the cell varies depending on where the cell was created.  Cells that represent a slot on the game board should have an <strong>Id</strong> that contains the column letter and the row number, ex: &ldquo;A4&rdquo;.  The cells that are made in the constructor of the <strong>Game</strong> class keep track of only columns; therefore, these cells with have an <strong>Id</strong> that only has the column letter, ex: &ldquo;A&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 id="properties">Properties</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>public DoubleLinkedListCell&lt;T&gt; Next</code>: The publicly accessibly property that is a reference to the next cell in the list.  This should have both get and set accessors using the default implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>public DoubleLinkedListCell&lt;T&gt; Previous</code>: The publicly accessibly property that stores a reference to the previous cell in the list.  This should have both get and set accessors using the default implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>public T Data</code>: The publicly accessibly property for storing the information in this cell.  This should have both get and set accessors using the default implementation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>public string Id</code>: The publicly accessibly property that is the unique identifier for the cell (see above for description).  This should have both get and set accessors using the default implementation</p>

<h3 id="playersturn--enum">PlayersTurn  Enum</h3>
<p>An enumeration to make it easier to identify who&rsquo;s turn it is.  Should contain Red and Black.  The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/enum" target="_blank"><strong>enum</strong> </a>
 keyword is used to declare an <a href="http://people.cs.ksu.edu/~rhowell/DataStructures/syntax/enumerations.html" target="_blank">enumeration</a>
.  An enumeration is a type that consists of a set of named constants.  The first name (in this case Red) would have a value of 0, the second, a value of 1, and so on.  But instead of using numbers to compare, we can just use the canonical representation (i.e. Red and Black).  The <em>PlayersTurn</em> enumerator can be declared like:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">enum</span> PlayersTurn

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	Black
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This enum should be placed directly inside the namespace and <strong>not</strong> inside of a class.</p>
<h3 id="game-class">Game Class</h3>
<p>The <strong>Game</strong> class is a public class to represent the game board.</p>
<h4 id="fields">Fields</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>public const int ColumnSize</code>:  The number of slots in each column.  This should be set to 6.  The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/const" target="_blank"><strong>const</strong></a>
 keyword is used to declare a constant.  A constant field <em>cannot</em> be changed or modified once it is declared.</li>
<li><code>public const string ColumnLabels</code>: A string that represents all of the column labels.  This should be set to <em>ABCDEFG</em>.</li>
<li><code>public readonly Color[] PlayerColors</code>:  A <code>readonly</code> array that keeps track of the available colors for the players.  The array should contain <code>Color.Red</code> and <code>Color.Black</code> in that order.  As a refresher, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/arrays/single-dimensional-arrays" target="_blank">this page</a>
 for how to initialize an array with values.  The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/readonly" target="_blank"><strong>readonly</strong></a>
 keyword is a modifier that prevents a field from being modified except when declared or in the constructor of the class it belongs to.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="properties-2">Properties</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>public PlayersTurn Turn</code>:  The public facing property that keeps track of who&rsquo;s turn it is.  This should be defaulted to Red&rsquo;s turn.  This should have both get and set accessors using the default implementation</li>
<li><code>public DoubleLinkedListCell&lt;DoubleLinkedListCell&lt;GamePiece&gt;&gt; Column</code>:  Public facing property that holds a reference to  the active column header cell (this is a cell in the double linked list at the top of the image under the &ldquo;Representing the Board&rdquo; section).  This should have both get and set accessors using the default implementation and be initialized to <code>null</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="constructors-2">Constructors</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>public Game()</code>: This is the constructor for the Game class.  For each of the column labels, use the <code>Columns</code> property to create the column headers double linked list as outlined in &ldquo;Representing the Board&rdquo; section above.  Note that the columns will not have any thing placed in them, so the Data property will not need to be set here.  The unit tests will be expecting that the Column property to be referencing the last column (column G) once the constructor has finished.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="methods">Methods</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>public void ChangeColumn(string columnId)</code>:  This method sets <code>Columns</code> to the cell that corresponds to the given column ID.  This should be a cell in the column headers doubly linked list as shown in &ldquo;Representing the Board&rdquo; above. You will need to search, potentially in both directions, starting from the current column.</li>
<li><code>public string PlaceNewPiece(Color color, string col, out int row)</code>: This method is used to put a new <strong>GamePiece</strong> into the double linked list and should return the ID of the piece that is placed.  Before creating and placing the piece, you will need to call the <code>ChangeColumn</code> method to make sure you are placing the piece in the right column.  If the <strong>Data</strong> in that column is <code>null</code> then you are placing the first piece into that double linked list, otherwise, it is not the first piece so you will have to link the new piece to the existing ones in that column.</li>
<li><code>public bool FindCell (char col, int row, out DoubleLinkedListCell&lt;GamePiece&gt; found)</code>: This method will return true/false if there is a  cell from <code>Column</code> that matches the given row and column.    This method should call <code>ChangeColumn</code> first in order to set <code>Column</code> to the correct column you should be searching in.  The cell found should be returned through the <em>out</em> parameter.  If no cell is found or the given row or column is outside the bounds of the game, the <em>out</em> parameter should be set to <code>null</code> and the method should return <code>false</code>.</li>
<li><code>private bool Check(int row, char col, int rowDirection, int colDirection, Color color)</code>: This is a helper method to the CheckWin method. This method checks whether there are four in a row of the given color in the given direction containing the given location.  The Check method should start looking at the cell at the given <em>row</em> and <em>col</em> location.  Traverse through the game board in the direction given by <em>rowDirection</em> and <em>colDirection</em> and compare color to each cell.  If it finds four of the given color in a row, then return <strong>true</strong>.  If there are not four of the given color in the given direction, reverse direction to check the other way.  If this doesn&rsquo;t yield four in a row, then you can safely return <strong>false</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Note: The direction parameters help identify which axis you are checking for four in a row.  There are four different axes: horizontal (<code>rowDirection=1</code>, <code>colDirection=0</code>), vertical(<code>rowDirection=0</code>, <code>colDirection=1</code>), top-right to bottom-left diagonal(<code>rowDirection=-1</code>, <code>colDirection=-1</code>), and  top-left to bottom-right diagonal(<code>rowDirection=-1</code>, <code>colDirection=1</code>).  It is important to remember that a winning piece may be placed in the middle of a winning sequence of pieces, so you will need to check both directions on the axis to be sure there is or is not four in a row.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>public bool CheckWin(DoubleLinkedListCell&lt;GamePiece&gt; cell)</code>: This method checks to see if the given <em>cell</em> was placed in a spot that connected four game pieces of the same color in a row.  It should check vertically, horizontally, diagonally from left to right, and diagonally from right to left by calling the <code>Check</code> helper method below.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="userinterface-class">UserInterface Class</h3>
<p>This class serves as the UI class.  Overall, it will populate the UI dynamically, as well as handle all of the in-game events. The ux fields referenced relate back to the UI components as described in the above &ldquo;User Interface&rdquo; section.</p>
<h4 id="fields-1">Fields</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>private Game _game</code>: Declare and instantiate this field within the UserInterface class to a new Game object.  This will give the UI class access to all of the aspects of the Game class.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="methodsevent-handlers">Methods/Event Handlers</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>private void SetColor(string id, Color color)</code>:  This method searches for the slot <strong>Label</strong> corresponding to the given Name through the <em>id</em> parameter.  To do this, use the <strong>Find</strong> method of the <strong>Controls</strong> property of the <em>uxBoardContainer</em> (the board layout panel).  Cast the result of find and then set the <strong>BackColor</strong> to the given <em>color</em> parameter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>private void uxPlaceButtonClick(object sender, EventArgs e)</code>:  This is the click event handler for the dynamically generated place buttons above.  This event handler takes care of placing a new game piece on the board in the corresponding column.  You can figure out which column you are working with by type casting the <strong>sender</strong> object to a <strong>Button</strong> and getting the <strong>Text</strong> property. You will need to place the new piece into the board&rsquo;s linked list by calling <code>PlaceNewPiece</code> (described above in the <strong>Game</strong> class).  After it is placed, be sure to set the color for the slot on the game board by calling <code>SetColor</code>, switch the player&rsquo;s turn, and checking if this last move caused the player to win by calling <code>CheckWin</code> in the <strong>Game</strong> class.  If the player won, display an appropriate message like &ldquo;Red Wins!&rdquo; and exit the game by using the code <code>Environment.Exit(0)</code>.  Also, if all of the slots were filled in that column, <strong>disable</strong> the place button so the players can&rsquo;t place any more chips in that column.  If the board is completely full, display that the game was a draw and exit.  <em>Hint: You can easily keep track of when the board is full by remembering the number of columns place buttons you disable</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>private void MakeUI()</code>:This needs to be modified to load all of the buttons that place the game pieces, as well as the slots on the board.  To do this, use two nested loops.  The outer loop should take care of loading each place button into the second FlowLayoutPanel. The <strong>Button</strong>s should have the following properties set:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Text</strong>: The letter for that column</li>
<li><strong>Width</strong>: 45</li>
<li><strong>Height</strong>: 20</li>
<li><strong>Margin</strong>: 5 (top, left, right, and bottom).  <em>Note: You will need to construct a new <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.padding?redirectedfrom=MSDN&amp;view=netframework-4.8" target="_blank">Padding</a>
 object for this value.</em></li>
<li><strong>Click</strong>: Bound to the <em>uxPlaceButtonClick</em> event handler.  This can be done using this syntax:</li>
</ul>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#"><span style="display:flex;"><span>theButton.Click += <span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> EventHandler(uxPlaceButtonClick);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You can add the newly created <strong>Button</strong> to the panel by calling the <code>Add</code> method from the <code>Controls</code> property of the panel.  Before moving onto the next column, be sure to load this column&rsquo;s slots on the board by using another loop based off of the <code>Game.ColumnSize</code> constant.  Each slot is represented by a <strong>Label</strong>.  They should be added to the UI in descending order  These labels should have the following properties set</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Width</strong>: 45</li>
<li><strong>Height</strong>: 45</li>
<li><strong>Margin</strong>: 5 (top, right, bottom, and left)</li>
<li><strong>BackColor</strong>: <strong>Color</strong>.White</li>
<li><strong>Name</strong>: Column letter + row number</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you also set the turn <strong>Label</strong> text to &ldquo;Red&rdquo;, the <code>BackColor</code> to <code>Color.Red</code>, and the <code>ForColor</code> to <code>Color.Black</code> before exiting the method.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="constructors-3">Constructors</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>public UserInterface()</code>:  The default constructor that initializes the UI components. You will be modifying this constructor so that it makes a new game and calls the <code>MakeUI</code> method.  Note that this should be done <em>after</em> the <code>InitializeComponent</code> call.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p>There are a good number of unit tests (particularly for the Game class) that will help you in debugging and testing.  Please note that while these cover a good number of cases, they are not completely exhaustive and do not test the UserInterface. You should double check the performance and behavior with the executable that was provided with the starting repository. Each player should be able to win the game in any vertical, horizontal, or diagonal direction.  If a column is full, the button for placing chips in that column should be disabled to prevent any more chips from being placed in that column.  If the board fills completely, make sure the game recognizes it as a draw.  An example of the draw looks like this:</p>

<p>The task for this assignment is to implement a minimum priority queue implemented using a van Emde Boas tree.  The algorithms described below are adapted from <em>Introduction to Algorithms - 3rd edition</em> by Corman, T.H, Leiserson, C.E., Rivest, R.L., and Stein, C.</p>
<h2 id="van-emde-boas-trees">van Emde Boas Trees</h2>
<p>The van Emde Boas tree, aka vEB tree, is a tree that utilizes an associative array with 
<span class="math align-center">$ u $</span>-bit integer keys.  This data structure is very efficient in operations it is able to perform (this includes search, predecessor, successor, insert, and delete).  Each of these operations are performed in 
<span class="math align-center">$ O( $</span>lg lg 
<span class="math align-center">$ u) $</span> time where 
<span class="math align-center">$ u $</span> is referred to as the universe of keys or maximum number of keys that can be stored.  vEB trees are bounded by this universe, so the tree will always take up space of size 
<span class="math align-center">$ u $</span> and once created, cannot be grown or shrunk (there are some alternatives to help get around this problem, but they are not explored in this implementation).  This makes vEB trees very efficient in terms of space when the tree is full, but not so much when the tree is sparse.  This, along with the restriction that keys may only be positive integers, make the vEB tree impractical for many applications.  However, due to its construction, it can be used to implement a priority queue faster than normal heap implementations.</p>
<p>A vEB tree is constructed by segmenting its universe into 
<span class="math align-center">$ \sqrt{u} $</span> vEB trees, where each subtree would be responsible for containing keys 
<span class="math align-center">$ i\sqrt{u} $</span> through 
<span class="math align-center">$ (i+1)\sqrt{u}-1 $</span>.  Since the structure is implemented recursively, at each level of the tree, the universe shrinks by a factor of 
<span class="math align-center">$ \sqrt{u} $</span>. We can start to sketch out the basis of this segmentation like so:</p>
<p>
<a href="#image-d3f55bc5cd2dde4c4608e9e615ed3fb5" class="lightbox-link">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis300/homework/needsmorecoffee44123/hw4-veb-tree-description/vebTree-vector.png" alt="vebTree-vector" style="height: auto; width: auto;" loading="lazy">
</a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox" id="image-d3f55bc5cd2dde4c4608e9e615ed3fb5">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis300/homework/needsmorecoffee44123/hw4-veb-tree-description/vebTree-vector.png" alt="vebTree-vector" class="lightbox-image" loading="lazy">
</a></p>
<p>In the above image, we have a 16 element universe where the bit 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span> indicates the presence of the corresponding number.  As such,  we can see that the above image contains the <em>set</em> of numbers 
<span class="math align-center">$ {2,3,4,5,6,14,15} $</span>.  The contents of the summary node indicate whether the corresponding child is nonempty – a 0 denotes an empty child, and a 1 denotes a nonempty child</p>
<p>The above structure could still be more efficient though.  By making it a recursive tree structure, we can reduce the universe in each level by 
<span class="math align-center">$ \sqrt{u} $</span>, where 
<span class="math align-center">$ u = 2^k $</span>.  This would leave the root to have a universe of size 
<span class="math align-center">$ \sqrt{u} $</span>, then down one level, the universe would be of size 
<span class="math align-center">$ u^{1/4} $</span> then 
<span class="math align-center">$ u^{1/8} $</span>… all the way down until 
<span class="math align-center">$ u = 2 $</span>. This works well for even powers of two; however, the square root of any odd power of 2 is not a whole number.  Rounding up (ceiling, denoted by 
<span class="math align-center">$ \left \lceil{value}\right \rceil  $</span>) or rounding down (floor denoted by 
<span class="math align-center">$ \left \lfloor{value}\right \rfloor  $</span> )  doesn&rsquo;t always produce a universe that is a power of two.  For example, 
<span class="math align-center">$ \sqrt{8}=2.83 $</span> rounded up or rounded down would not give the root node the correct universe.  In order to allow odd powers of 2, we need to define the root of our tree to have a universe equal to the upper square root of 
<span class="math align-center">$ u $</span> (defined as 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2^{\left \lceil{k/2}\right \rceil } $</span>), pointing to the upper square root of 
<span class="math align-center">$ u $</span> subtrees containing a universe equal to the lower square root of 
<span class="math align-center">$ u $</span> (defined as 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2^{\left \lfloor{k/2}\right \rfloor } $</span>).</p>
<p>We also keep track of the minimum and maximum element within each tree node. Note that an element stored in <em>min</em> is not stored in any child of that node if the tree contains two or more elements, but the element stored in <em>max</em> does.  We also store with each node a summary, which is another vEB tree storing as its keys the indices of the nonempty subtrees of the node. Note that its universe is therefore the upper square root of u. When an element is inserted into a subtree that is empty, the index of that subtree is also inserted into the summary.  For nodes where 
<span class="math align-center">$ u = 2 $</span> (i.e. leaf nodes), we can use 
<span class="math align-center">$ min $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ max $</span> to store the elements, therefore all leaves will have a null summary and cluster. The vEB tree node structure can be seen below (<em>Note that clusters can also be referred to as <strong>subtrees</strong> or <strong>children</strong></em>). The notation 
<span class="math align-center">$ vEB(u) $</span> indicates a vEB tree node with universe size 
<span class="math align-center">$ u $</span>.</p>
<p>![veb-tree-node-Introduction_to_algorithms-3rd Edition](veb-tree-node-Introduction_to_algorithms-3rd Edition.png)</p>
<p>But how do we know where any element gets placed within a tree? To do this, we will utilize three different functions:</p>

<span class="math align-left">
$$
high(key) = \left \lfloor{key/lowerSqrt(u)}\right \rfloor\\
low(key) = key\ \%\ lowerSqrt(u)\\
index(subtree,offset) = subtree*lowerSqrt(u) + offset
$$
</span>
<p>These functions help segment out the bits in each level.  We want to separate them into least significant and most significant bits in order to determine where a given key is placed. The 
<span class="math align-center">$ high $</span> function references the most significant 
<span class="math align-center">$ \left \lfloor{k/2}\right \rfloor  $</span> bits, which tells us what subtree/cluster the 
<span class="math align-center">$ key $</span> belongs to.  The 
<span class="math align-center">$ low $</span> function references the least 
<span class="math align-center">$ \left \lceil{k/2}\right \rceil  $</span>significant bits, which tells us the position of 
<span class="math align-center">$ key $</span> within that subtree (i.e., low(key) is the key added to this subtree).  Finally, 
<span class="math align-center">$ index $</span> will compute the value of a key given the index of the subtree and the position of that key within that subtree, treating the 
<span class="math align-center">$ subtree $</span> index as the most significant bits and 
<span class="math align-center">$ offset $</span> as the least significant bits of the element.</p>
<p>We can see how these work in a vEB tree that contains the following set of numbers: 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2,3,4,5,7,14,15 $</span>.The writing in orange gives the original key represented by a value. For example, 7 is expressed as a 4-bit binary number as 0111. The high-order portion tells us that it belongs in subtree 1 of the root. Its value in this node is 3 (the low-order half of 7, or 11 in binary). The high-order part of 11 tells us it is stored in subtree 1 of this subtree, and the low-order portion tells us it is stored as the value 1 in this node.  Green writing indicates the cluster that the summary corresponds to.  And purple writing indicates the position in the original bit vector from our earlier image.  A slash indicates that that value has not been set (in our implementation, that would be -1).</p>

<h4 id="properties">Properties</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>public int Min</code>:  This property stores the smallest key in this tree.  This should have a public get accessor and a private set accessor using the default implementation.</li>
<li><code>public int Max</code>:  This property stores the largest key in this tree.  This should have a public get accessor and a private set accessor using the default implementation.</li>
<li><code>public VebTreeNode[] Clusters</code>:  This property stores subtrees that correspond to clusters of bits in the vEB Tree.  The number of subtrees is equal to the upper square root of the universe for a universe greater than 2.  For a universe of size 2, no clusters are stored.   This  property should have a public get accessor and a private set accessor using the default implementation.</li>
<li><code>public VebTreeNode Summary</code>:  This property stores an auxiliary tree that keeps track of which clusters contain elements.  This should have a public get accessor and a private set accessor using the default implementation.</li>
<li><code>public int Universe</code>:  This property keeps track of maximum number of bits/keys this tree can contain.  This should have a public get accessor and a private set accessor using the default implementation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fields">Fields</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>private int _power</code>: This private field stores the power of 2 the tree&rsquo;s universe.  In the discussion of the vEB tree earlier, this field represents 
<span class="math align-center">$ k $</span> in 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2^k $</span>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="methods">Methods</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>public double LowerSquareRoot()</code>:  This method calculates the lower square root of the <code>Universe</code> as defined in 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2^{\left \lfloor{k/2}\right \rfloor } $</span></li>
<li><code>public int UpperSquareRoot()</code>:  This method calculates the lower square root of the <code>Universe</code>, cast as an integer, as defined in 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2^{\left \lceil{k/2}\right \rceil } $</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="constructors">Constructors</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>public VebTreeNode(int universeSize)</code>:  This is the only constructor for the VebTreeNode class.  Since the structure of a vEB tree is dependent on the size of its universe, once a tree is created, the size of its universe cannot be changed.  The universe should be restricted to only positive powers of 2.  If it is not, an <code>ArgumentException</code> should be thrown.  You can check for this in a couple of ways: you can do a bit-wise and between the universe and the universe - 1.  If this result is is not 0, then it is not a power of 2.  You can also compare 
<span class="math align-center">$ \left \lfloor{\log_2universe}\right \rfloor $</span> to 
<span class="math align-center">$ \left \lceil{\log_2universe}\right \rceil $</span>.  If they differ, then it is not a power of 2.  Note that in each of these ways, you will need to have a special case for 0.</p>
<p>Since no elements have been inserted into the tree at this point, <code>Min</code> and <code>Max</code> should be initialized to -1.  If the Universe is less than or equal to 2, then this node does not need a <code>Summary</code> or <code>Clusters</code>.  Otherwise, the length of <code>Clusters</code> and the universe of <code>Summary</code> is equal to the upper square root of <code>Universe</code>.  Each subtree contained in <code>Clusters</code> should be initialized to a <code>VebTreeNode</code> with a universe equal to the lower square root of <code>Universe</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="methods-continued">Methods (continued)</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>public int High(int key)</code>: returns which subtree the given key belongs to as described in the earlier &ldquo;van Embde Boas Trees&rdquo; section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>public int Low(int key)</code>: returns the position the given key is at within a subtree as described in the earlier &ldquo;van Embde Boas Trees&rdquo; section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>public int Index(int subtree, int offset)</code>: returns the element based from the given subtree and offset values  as described in the earlier &ldquo;van Embde Boas Trees&rdquo; section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>public void Insert(int key)</code>: This recursive method inserts the given key into the tree.  The key must be a positive integer that is strictly less than the <code>Universe</code>.  If it is not, an argument exception should be thrown.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the value of <code>Min</code> has not been set, then this key is the first element to be inserted into this node, therefore we only need to set the min and max to the value of the key.</li>
<li>Otherwise,
<ul>
<li>if the key is strictly less than the minimum element, then the key is the new smallest element so swap it with <code>Min</code> (i.e. key becomes the new <code>Min</code> and <code>Min</code> becomes the key we are inserting).</li>
<li>if we are on an internal tree node (the universe is larger than 2), then we need to calculate which cluster the key should be inserted into (utilize the <code>High</code> and <code>Low</code> functions above).  If this is the first key to be inserted into the corresponding cluster, then the index of that cluster should be inserted into the <code>Summary</code>.   Recursion should be used to insert into the summary and cluster.  Note that you are not strictly inserting the key into the cluster, but the position of the key within that cluster.</li>
<li>Lastly, if the key being inserted is larger than the current maximum element, update <code>Max</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>public bool Find(int key)</code>:  This recursive method searches the tree to determine whether or not the given key exists in this tree.  If the key is larger than or equal to the universe, then return false as this key is outside the possible universe of keys this tree can hold.  If the <code>Min</code> or <code>Max</code> are equal to the key, then this key exists in the tree, but if not, and the universe is of size 2, then the key does not exists in this tree.  Otherwise, we recursively call <code>Find</code> on the key&rsquo;s corresponding cluster, passing the position of the key in that cluster as a parameter (utilize the <code>High</code> and <code>Low</code> functions).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>public int Successor(int key)</code>:  This recursive method returns the next largest key stored in the tree after the given key.  If no successor is found, then -1 is returned.  Note that this key does not have to be in the tree in order for it to have a successor.</p>
<p>This method has two base cases.  The first base case is that the universe is of size 2. Then if the key is 0 and Max is 1, then the successor must be 1; otherwise, no successor exists. (because if the key is 1 then no element exists here larger than the key, similar reasoning applies if the key is 0 but the Max is not set).  The second base case, when the universe is not of size 2, is that if the key is greater than -1 but less than <code>Min</code>, then the <code>Min</code> is key&rsquo;s successor.</p>
<p>Otherwise the successor may be contained in the subtree containing the the key.  Compute the index of the subtree by utilizing the <code>High</code> method.  If the subtree at this index has <code>Max</code> defined and the position of the key (utilize the <code>Low</code> method) is less than this maximum then the successor is somewhere in that subtree, then to compute that successor, we will utilize the <code>Index</code> method, where the offset is the result of recursively calculating the  successor of the position of the original key within the subtree.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if the key&rsquo;s position in the subtree is greater or equal to than the subtree&rsquo;s maximum, then we compute the successors cluster (referred to as <em>successorClusterIndex</em>) by recursively calculating the successor of the subtree index within the <code>Summary</code>.  If <em>successorClusterIndex</em> is -1 then no successor exists.  Otherwise, the successor is found by by calling the <code>Index</code> method, using the <em>successorClusterIndex</em> as the subtree and the <code>Min</code> value contained in the subtree located at <em>successorClusterIndex</em> as the offset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>public void Remove(int keyToRemove)</code>: This recursive method handles removing the given key from the tree.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This method has two base cases First, if the minimum and maximum elements are the same and the <em>keyToRemove</em> is equal to <code>Min</code>, then <em>key</em> is the last element being removed in this node, so <code>Min</code> and <code>Max</code> should be reset to -1.  Otherwise, if the universe size is 2, then we are removing the key from a leaf node, so <code>Min</code> and <code>Max</code> get set to the remaining value (this would be either 0 or 1).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>(recursive case)</em> Otherwise we will need to find where the <em>key</em> is located in the tree.  If the minimum element in this node is the key, then we will be deleting the minimum value.  As such, we will need to replace <code>Min</code> by the next smallest element in the cluster.  This is done by using the <code>Index</code> method, where subtree is the minimum element (<em>referred to as minIndex in this description</em>) in the <code>Summary</code> and the offset is the minimum value of the cluster located at <em>minIndex</em>.  The value returned by <code>Index</code> is not only the new <code>Min</code>, but it is also the new key we need to remove.  (Remember that the minimum value is not stored anywhere in a vebTree&rsquo;s children, so we will need to remove it)</p>
<p>We can now recursively remove the <code>keyToRemove</code> from its corresponding cluster (note that when recursively calling Remove here, you will need to pass the <em>position</em> of the key in the cluster, not the key itself).</p>
<p>After the key has been removed, we will need to do a couple of checks.  First, if the key removed was the last in its cluster, then we also need to remove that cluster from the summary.  If this is the case, we need will also need to update <code>Max</code>.  If the Summary&rsquo;s maximum element is -1, then <code>Max</code> gets set to <code>Min</code>.  Otherwise <code>Max</code> should be set to the maximum element in the highest numbered cluster (calculated using the <code>Index</code> method, using <code>Summary.Max</code> as the subtree and the <code>Max</code> of the cluster located at <code>Summary.Max</code>).</p>
<p>Otherwise, if the key that we removed was this node&rsquo;s <code>Max</code>, then we just deleted the maximum element.  <code>Max</code> should then be replaced by the next largest element in the cluster (calculated using the <code>Index</code> method, using the subtree index of the key we removed and that subtree&rsquo;s <code>Max</code>).</p>

<h3 id="minpriorityqueue-class">MinPriorityQueue Class</h3>
<p>The **MinPriorityQueue ** class is a public class that implements a minimum priority queue utilizing a vEB tree.  Note that our queue can only store positive integers due to the restriction of the vEB tree implementation.</p>
<h4 id="fields-1">Fields</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>private VebTreeNode _elements</code>:  This field stores the vEB tree that represents all the elements in the minimum priority queue.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="properties-1">Properties</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>public int MinimumPriority</code>:  This property has only a get accessor that returns the minimum element from the vEB tree.  If the queue is empty, this property should throw an <code>InvalidOperationException</code>.</li>
<li><code>public int Count</code>: This property keeps track of how many elements are in the queue.  This should have a public get accessor and a private set accessor using the default implementation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="constructors-1">Constructors</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>MinPriorityQueue(int maxSize)</code>:  The constructor of this class takes in the maximum number of elements the queue can have as a parameter.  This is used to initialize the vEB tree stored in <code>_elements</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="methods-1">Methods</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>public void Enqueue(int num)</code>:  This method inserts the given number into the queue.</li>
<li><code>public int Dequeue()</code>:  This method removes the element with the minimum priority (the smallest element) from the queue and returns it.  This method should throw an InvalidOperationException if there are no elements in the queue.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p>The unit tests given with this project provide high code coverage for both the MinPriorityQueue and the VebTreeNode classes.  However, passing all of the test cases does not guarantee 100% on the homework assignment. The torture tests that verify efficiency of your solution should be able to be ran successfully on the remote desktop server within the allotted time.  Most computers will be able to complete those tests well under the time limits.</p>
<h2 id="submitting-your-assignment">Submitting Your Assignment</h2>
<p>Be sure you <strong>commit</strong> all your changes and <strong>push</strong> your commits to your GitHub repository. (<strong>Note:</strong> Prior to committing changes, it is a good idea to refresh the Team Explorer by clicking the circular arrow icon at the top.) Then submit the <em>entire URL</em> of the <strong>commit</strong> that you want graded. There is no need to submit a comment, as you will not have a completion code.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> If the URL you submit does not contain the 40-hex-digit fingerprint of the commit you want graded, <strong>you will receive a 0</strong>, as this fingerprint is the only way we can verify that you completed your code prior to submitting your assignment. We will only grade the source code that is included in the commit that you submit. Therefore, be sure that the commit on GitHub contains all four &ldquo;.cs&rdquo; files, and that they are the version you want graded. This is especially important if you had any trouble committing or pushing your code.</p>
