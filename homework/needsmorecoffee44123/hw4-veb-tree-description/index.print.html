van Emde Boas Trees The van Emde Boas tree, aka vEB tree, is a tree that utilizes an associative array with $ u $-bit integer keys. This data structure is very efficient in operations it is able to perform (this includes search, predecessor, successor, insert, and delete). Each of these operations are performed in $ O( $lg lg $ u) $ time where $ u $ is referred to as the universe of keys or maximum number of keys that can be stored. vEB trees are bounded by this universe, so the tree will always take up space of size $ u $ and once created, cannot be grown or shrunk (there are some alternatives to help get around this problem, but they are not explored in this implementation). This makes vEB trees very efficient in terms of space when the tree is full, but not so much when the tree is sparse. This, along with the restriction that keys may only be positive integers, make the vEB tree impractical for many applications. However, due to its construction, it can be used to implement a priority queue faster than normal heap implementations."><meta name=author content="Rod Howell and Josh Weese"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:description content="User Requirements The task for this assignment is to implement a minimum priority queue implemented using a van Emde Boas tree.
