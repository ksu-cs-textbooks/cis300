Specifically, we have a number of data items, each having a unique key. This key may be any type, and is used to find the associated data item; i.e., given a key we need to find the data item associated with that key. A data structure that provides this kind of access is called a dictionary. In this chapter, we will examine a dictionary class provided by .NET. We will then consider two ways of implementing dictionaries. Later chapters will examine improvements over these implementations.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/dictionaries/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><item><title>The Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue> Class</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/dictionaries/dictionary-tkey-tvalue/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/dictionaries/dictionary-tkey-tvalue/</guid><description>The Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue> Class In this section, we will discuss the use of the Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue> class, which implements a dictionary. In the next section, we will discuss how this data structure can be implemented using a linked list. In subsequent sections, we will consider alternative implementations.
Note that the Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue> type has two type parameters, TKey and TValue. TKey is the type of the keys, and TValue is the type of the values (i.e., the data elements associated with the keys). Keys must always be non-null — any attempt to use a null key will result in an ArgumentNullException. A Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue>’s most basic public methods are:</description></item><item><title>Implementing a Dictionary with a Linked List</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/dictionaries/linked-list-impl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/dictionaries/linked-list-impl/</guid><description>Implementing a Dictionary with a Linked List One way of implementing a dictionary is to store all the keys and values in a linked list. We want to do this in such a way that a key is stored together with its associated value. To facilitate this, .NET provides a structure KeyValuePair&lt;TKey, TValue> in the System.Collections.Generic namespace. This structure is used simply for storing a key and a value. The type parameter TKey is used to define the type of the keys, and the other type parameter TValue is used to define the type of the values. It has two public properties:</description></item><item><title>Implementing a Dictionary with an Array-Like Structure</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/dictionaries/binary-search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/dictionaries/binary-search/</guid><description>Implementing a Dictionary with an Array-Like Structure In the previous section, we discussed how linked lists could be used to implement a dictionary. An alternative to a linked list would be an array. A couple of other alternatives are the non-generic System.Collections.ArrayList or the generic System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;T>. These classes are similar to singly-dimensioned arrays, but they can grow as needed. In this respect, they are like a StringBuilder, but instead of storing chars, an ArrayList stores object?s and a List&lt;T> stores instances of the type parameter T. Elements can be retrieved from instances of these classes using indexing, just like retrieving an element from an array.</description></item></channel></rss>
