      <description>Input/Output Input and output are central concepts to computing - in order to be able to accomplish a computational task, a program must typically process some input and produce some output. Input and output may be presented in a variety of ways. For example, many programs communicate with users through a graphical user interface, or GUI. In the simplest case, the user performs some action, such as clicking the mouse on a button, thus signaling an event.</description>

      <title>strings and StringBuilders</title>
      <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis300/strings/index.html</link>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis300/strings/index.html</guid>
      <description>strings and StringBuilders C# and .NET provide two data structures for representing sequences of characters - strings and StringBuilders. Each of these data structures has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this chapter, we will examine how these two types are used and implemented. In the process, we will note the tradeoffs involved in using one or the other.</description>

      <title>Stacks and Queues</title>
      <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis300/stacks-queues/index.html</link>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis300/stacks-queues/index.html</guid>
      <description>Stacks and Queues Often in solving problems, we need to access data items in a particular order. Consider, for example, the action of an &amp;ldquo;Undo&amp;rdquo; operation in a text editor, spreadsheet, or similar application. If we want to be able to undo a sequence of these operations, we need to record each operation as it is done. When we want to undo an operation, we need to retrieve the operation to undo from the recorded sequence of operations.</description>

      <description>Linked Lists Using arrays to implement data structures has performance advantages in some cases, but this technique has its limitations. With this chapter, we begin a study of data structures that use reference types in a powerful way. Rather than forming sequences by placing data items in adjacent cells of an array, we instead use references to chain data elements together in a sequence. For some applications, this ends up being more efficient than using an array.</description>

      <title>Dictionaries</title>

      <description>Dictionaries A common problem in computing is that of keyed storage and retrieval. Specifically, we have a number of data items, each having a unique key. This key may be any type, and is used to find the associated data item; i.e., given a key we need to find the data item associated with that key. A data structure that provides this kind of access is called a dictionary. In this chapter, we will examine a dictionary class provided by .</description>

      <description>Trees Binary search provides an efficient way to find elements in a sorted array-like structure. However, inserting or removing from an array-like structure can be expensive because all subsequent data elements must be moved to accommodate the change. On the other hand, linked lists can be modified efficiently, provided we have a reference to the cell preceding the insertion or deletion point. However, finding a cell can be expensive because the only way to search a linked list is to start at the front and work through it a cell at a time.</description>

      <title>Hash Tables</title>
      <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis300/hashing/index.html</link>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis300/hashing/index.html</guid>
      <description>Hash Tables Throughout our discussion of dictionary implementations over the last two chapters, we have taken advantage of the fact that the keys were sorted when looking up specific keys. In this chapter, we examine a rather surprising result &amp;mdash; that we can achieve better performance if we don&amp;rsquo;t have to keep the keys in any particular order (i.e., so that we can process them in that order). The technique uses a data structure known as a hash table, which is the underlying data structure in .</description>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis300/graphs/index.html</guid>
      <description>Graphs In this chapter, we examine a data structure known as a graph, which can be used to represent a wide variety of data sets in which pairs of data items are related in a certain way. Examples of such data sets include road maps, data flows or control flows in programs, and representations of communication networks. Because graphs are so widely used, numerous algorithms on graphs have been devised. As a result, the same algorithm can often be applied to a variety of applications because the underlying data structure for each application is a graph.</description>

      <description>Sorting We conclude this text with a look at a common activity in computing, namely, sorting data. While .NET provides several methods for sorting data, it is instructive to examine the implementation details of different techniques. While there is one sorting algorithm that is used more commonly than the others, none is best for all situations. An understanding of which algorithms perform better in different situations can help us to make better choices and thereby achieve better performance for the software we build.</description>
