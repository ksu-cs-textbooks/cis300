<h2 id="memoization">Memoization</h2>
<p>We we will now present an example of a common technique involving
dictionaries. Consider the following variation of the 2-player game,
Nim. The board consists of a number of stones arranged into several
piles. Associated with each nonempty pile is a <em>limit</em>, which is a
positive integer no greater than the number of stones on that pile (the
limit for an empty pile is always 0). Players alternate taking stones
according to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>On each turn, the player must take some number of stones from a
single pile.</li>
<li>The number of stones taken must be at least 1, but no more than the
current limit for that pile.</li>
<li>Taking <em>n</em> stones from a pile changes the limit for that pile to
2<em>n</em>. (If this limit is more than the number of stones remaining on
that pile, the new limit is the number of stones remaining.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The player taking the last stone wins. Note that by the rules of the
game, there will always be a winner &mdash; a draw is impossible.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we start a game with three piles, each containing
10 stones with a limit of 9. We will denote this board position as
(10/9; 10/9; 10/9). If Player 1 removes two stones from Pile 1, the
resulting position is (8/4; 10/9; 10/9). Note that because 2 stones were
removed from Pile 1, its new limit is 2 x 2 = 4. If Player 2
now removes 4 stones from Pile 2, the resulting position is (8/4; 6/6;
10/9). Note that because 4 stones were removed, the new limit for Pile 2
would become 2 x 4 = 8; however, because only 6 stones
remain, the new limit is 6. Play then continues until a player wins by
taking all remaining stones.</p>
<p>Let us define a <em>winning play</em> as any play giving a position from which
there is no winning play. Thus, if we make a winning play, there are two
possible cases. In the first case, there are no winning plays from the
resulting position because there are no legal plays. This means we just
took the last stone and won the game. In the other case, there are legal
plays, but none is a winning play. Our opponent must make one of these
plays. Because it isn&rsquo;t a winning play, there must be a winning play
from the resulting position. Therefore, an optimal strategy is to make a
winning play whenever one exists. Because of the way a winning play is
defined, if a winning play exists, following this strategy will enable
us to continue to make winning plays until we eventually win the game.
If no winning play exists, we just have to make some play and hope that
our opponent blunders by making a play that is not a winning play. If
that happens, a winning play will be available, and our strategy leads
us to a win.</p>
<p>Consider the following examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example 1</strong>: (1/1; 0/0). Taking one stone from Pile 1 is a winning
play because there is no legal play from the resulting position;
hence, there can be no winning play from it.</li>
<li><strong>Example 2</strong>: (1/1; 1/1). There is no winning play from this
position because both legal plays give essentially the position from
Example 1, from which there is a winning play.</li>
<li><strong>Example 3</strong>: (2/2; 1/1). Taking one stone from Pile 1 is a winning
play because it leads to (1/1; 1/1), from which there is no winning
play, as shown in Example 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given enough stones and piles, finding a winning play or determining
that there is none is challenging. In order to develop a search
algorithm somewhat similar to the one described in <a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis300/trees/tries/word-games">“Tries in Word Games”</a>, we can define the
following tree:</p>
<ul>
<li>The root is the current board position.</li>
<li>The children of a node are all the positions that can be reached by
making legal plays.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the tree defined by (2/2; 2/2) is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="nim-tree.jpg" alt="The tree defined by a Nim position."></p>
<p>The winning plays have been marked with a &lsquo;W&rsquo; in the above tree. As in
<a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis300/trees/tries/word-games">“Tries in Word Games”</a>,
this tree is not a data structure, but simply a mental guide to building
a search algorithm. Specifically, we can find a winning play (or
determine whether there is none) by traversing the tree in the following
way:</p>
<ul>
<li>For each legal play <em>p</em> from the given position:
<ul>
<li>Form the board position that results from making this play (this
position is a child).</li>
<li>Recursively find a winning play from this new position.</li>
<li>If there was no winning play returned (i.e., it was <strong>null</strong>),
return <em>p</em>, as it&rsquo;s a winning play.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If we get to this point we&rsquo;ve examined all the plays, and none of
them is winning; hence we return <strong>null</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the above algorithm may not examine all the nodes in the tree
because once it finds a winning play, it returns it immediately without
needing to examine any more children. For example, when processing the
children of the node (1/1; 2/2), it finds that from its second child,
(1/1; 1/1), there is no winning play; hence, it immediately returns the
play that removes one stone from Pile 2 without even looking at the
third child, (1/1; 0/0). Even so, because the size of the tree grows
exponentially as the number of stones increases, once the number of
stones reaches about 25, the time needed for the algorithm becomes
unacceptable.</p>
<p>Notice that several of the nodes in the tree occur multiple times. For
example, (1/1; 1/1) occurs twice and (1/1; 0/0) occurs five times. For a
large tree, the number of duplicate nodes in the tree increases
dramatically. The only thing that determines the presence of a winning
move is the board position; hence, once we have a winning move (or know
that none exists) for a given position, it will be the same wherever
this position may occur in the tree. We can therefore save a great deal
of time by saving the winning move for any position we examine. Then
whenever we need to examine a position, we first check to see if we&rsquo;ve
already processed it &mdash; if so, we just use the result we obtained earlier
rather than processing it again. Because processing it again may involve
searching a large tree, the savings in time might be huge.</p>
<p>The technique outlined in the above paragraph is known as <em>memoization</em>
(not to be confused with <em>memorization</em>) &mdash; we make a <em>memo</em> of the
results we compute so that we can look them up again later if we need
them. A dictionary whose keys are board positions and whose values are
plays is an ideal data structure for augmenting the above search with
memoization. As the first step, before we look at any plays from the
given board position, we look up the position in the dictionary. If we
find it, we immediately return the play associated with it. Otherwise,
we continue the algorithm as before, but prior to returning a play (even
if it is <strong>null</strong>), we save that play in the dictionary with the given
board position as its key. This memoization will allow us to analyze
board positions containing many more stones.</p>
<p>To implement the above strategy, we need to define two types - one to
represent a board position and one to represent a play. The type
representing a play needs to be a class so that we can use <strong>null</strong> to
indicate that there is no winning play. The type representing a board
position can be either a class or a structure. Because the dictionary
needs to be able to compare instances of this type for equality in order
be able to find keys, its definition will need to re-define the equality
comparisons. Consequently, we need to redefine the hash code computation
to be consistent with the equality comparison. The next two sections
will examine these topics.</p>
