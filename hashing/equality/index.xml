Furthermore, we need to be able to compare instances of this type for equality. Before we can address how this can be done, we first need to take a careful look at how C# handles equality. In what follows, we will discuss how C# handles the == operator, the non-static Equals method, and two static methods for determining equality. We will then show how the comparison can be defined so that all of these mechanisms behave in a consistent way.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/hashing/equality/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
