This is done by overriding that type’s GetHashCode method. In order for hashing to be implemented correctly and efficiently, this method should satisfy the following goals:
Equal keys must have the same hash code. This is necessary in order for the Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue> class to be able to find a given key that it has stored.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/hashing/hash-functions/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
