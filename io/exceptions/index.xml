Some of these problems include:
Trying to write to a read-only file. Trying to access a file that is locked by another process. Accessing an external drive that becomes disconnected. Note that some of these issues are beyond the programmerâ€™s control, while others may be tedious for the programmer to check. When one of these problems prevents an I/O operation from completing successfully, an exception is thrown.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis300/io/exceptions/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
