      <description>Message Boxes The MessageBox class (found in the System.Windows.Forms namespace) provides a simple mechanism for displaying a message and obtaining one of a few simple responses from the user. The most common usage of a MessageBox is to call one of its various Show methods, each of which is static . The simplest Show method takes a string as its only parameter. The method then displays this string in a modal dialog containing an &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo; button.</description>

      <description>File Dialogs The System.Windows.Forms namespace contains two other classes that implement modal dialogs for obtaining file names from the user. These classes are OpenFileDialog , which is designed to obtain the name of a file to read, and SaveFileDialog , which is designed to obtain the name of a file to write. Because we often need to obtain the name of a file prior to doing file I/O, it is appropriate to consider these classes now.</description>

      <description>Custom Dialogs While the dialogs provided by the .NET Framework are useful in a variety of applications, there are times when we need to be able to design our own special-purpose dialog to obtain specific information from the user. This section outlines how Visual StudioÂ® can be used to build such a dialog.
Let&amp;rsquo;s begin by considering a simple example. Suppose we are building an application that needs a dialog to obtain from the user the following pieces of information:</description>
